            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What inſtruction would the man have the ſimpler ſort and well meaning people (to abuſe whom is the end of this diſcourſe) gather from all this? would he have them think, and put them in fear, that what he affirmeth to have been the practice of their chief and leading men, and moſt cried up for their zeal to the good cauſe in hand in their own kingdom, where they had greateſt obligations, and no want of Oaths and Covenants, may fall out to be ſo in this? we will hope better things, though this mans premiſes (the proof where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we leave to himſelf) look towards ſuch a concluſion, in as good Logick or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he makes uſe of all along in this diſcourſe to aſperſe others withall. He complains further, <hi>that thoſe, who were employed againſt the enemies, betrayed their truſt, omitted many fair opportunities and good occaſions, which in appearance might have made an end of the War, that others complyed with the Enemie and helped him ſecretly with advice; ill ſymptoms all in ſuch a time as this is:</hi> But becauſe the man takes upon him to declare, in the name of the Scots, what he pleaſeth, as <hi>pag.</hi> 60. and to avow and disavow in their behalf, (by what Commiſſion, and by whom inſtructed, it were well worth the knowing) we will ſuppoſe him alſo inſtructed to anſwer, any demands in their names, which ſhall be made: he can tell us how it came to paſs that ſuch men were imployed, who brake their truſt, and ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, who did comply with the enemie for the advancement of their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Did it ariſe from hence, that in all their affairs and negotiations, they are an open hearted and plain dealing people in whom there is no guile, no cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but meaſuring others by themſelves, they are the leſs cautious and more apt to be deceived, being not at all ſuſpitious? If this be a right character of them, as he ſometimes will have it, we have lighted very unhappily amongſt ſo many plain hearts, upon ſuch a one as he is, and ſome others of them like himſelf, who with ſo much induſtrie, as the father of lyes can hardly exceed it, ſtudie and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor nothing more by their Pamphlets, Papers, and Emiſſaries for the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of their deſignes, than to raiſe jealouſies, and ſuſpitions in the minds of the ſimpler ſort of thoſe perſons, and for ſuch things, as it is probable they that raiſe them, do not themſelves believe either the perſons guiltie thereof, or the things true. Remember, the hidden things of darkneſs will one day be brought to light. If you turn to the 118, 119, 120. <hi>pages</hi> of this diſcourſe, there you ſhall have himſelf very freely and liberally giving in unto you, <hi>the cauſe</hi> why ſuch men, by whom he ſaith they have been betrayed, were intruſted. In theſe late Troubles, which in humane reaſon had ended in the ruine both of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and that which this man ſo often calls their Religion, had not their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>England</hi> refuſed abſolutely to aſſiſt or engage againſt them, though all means were uſed both in Parliament and out of Parliament, by threats, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, by oaths invented to enſnare them and oblige them thereunto; which refuſal proved an aſſiſtance unto them, enabling them to do their work and coſt them nothing, a thing that deſerves much better to be remembered than that which this man ſo often lays in our diſh. Yea, when they had done their own work by this means, this Nation was content to pay them their wages in the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly aſſiſtance ſo freely given them: all this is written in the Sands, and our ears are filled with nothing but <hi>the Miracles done for us by the SCOTS;</hi> well, yet when we had put this advantage into their hands, of Settling their own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs as they would themſelves, what Peace did they make? In the Concluſion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171593:3"/> to piece up all; this mans Friend, that mans Kinſman, and the Allies of another muſt be ſpared; to facilitate which, Titles of Honor, and Offices of profit muſt be conferred, and when this was done, theſe men muſt be received into their ſocieties, yea, into their Councils and imployments, though they had been found guiltie, and declared Enemies to the State, as this man tells you with regreet, for ſaith he, <hi>What is there that the</hi> Scots <hi>will not do for their Friends, Kindred, and Allies:</hi> by making up their breaches in this manner, when ſo much had been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, as that they ſent the Examinations up to the Parliament in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; they had gotten a Wolf by the ears; if the men connived at wear not alſo confided in, but laid aſide, they would become Enemies again: if truſted and imployed, they had opportunitie put into their hands, to ſtrengthen their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and increaſe their Faction, that which the School-maſter ſaith (and is much ſcandalized at it) <hi>they altogether ſtudied and aimed at, plotting, cabballing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing how to ſupplant one another to that end:</hi> theſe are his own words, and it ſhould ſeem by him ſomething is effected in regard of their Factions. The tables are turned, the High men before are now become Low men. Let the Honeſt men therefore amongſt them look to themſelves, and keep to their old friends, notwithſtanding the leſſons this School-maſter would teach them. The man takes this occaſion to make oſtentation of his Impartiallitie, <hi>Tros Tyriúſque mihi, nullo diſcrimine agetur;</hi> be he a <hi>Scot,</hi> or be he an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, all is one, he ſhall have his leſſon taught him, and ſo he begins to read ſome lectures fit for boys to hear, and the ſimpler ſort to be coſened withall, every wiſe man ſeeth what is aymed at, he would gain ſome credit hereby to be the ſooner believed in thoſe Scandals he deſires to fix upon honeſter men than himſelf, to take credit from them, that they may not keep his well meaning people from being abuſed by him and thoſe of his Council, which is the main end and drift of this Pamphlet. But lay aſide your Stage-Play, your grave documents to thoſe of your own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and let them take out this one leſſon from their own experience and learn it well, that will be to ſome purpoſe, all this is but hiſtrionicall, and you do but <hi>perſonam agere</hi> in it: Let them take heed in reſpect to themſelves, as well as of us, that they do not byas us into a Peace which ſhall not be ſafe and well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe are good words and often uſed, let nothing be practiſed which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not with them, let them not be made uſe of to bring about other mens ends (which it may be they ſee not into the depth of) hoping to make uſe of ſuch men again to effect their own, leſt God who will curſs the one, do alſo juſtly croſs the other. Let them not endeavour to make their advantages of our fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh diviſions amongſt our ſelves, leſt in the iſſue they finde themſelves thereby divided from the true cauſe and end, which they ſhould onely promote and aym at in their Coming into this Kingdom, at which God being displeaſed, can eaſily lay open all to the world, and as eaſily cruſh them in the cloſing of thoſe diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they would needs thruſt themſelves between to hold up, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for their own ends. There needs none of theſe carnal and fleſhly deviſes (for ſuch are all Diviſions and Contentions made uſe of) to carry on a good cauſe: neither doth he like to be helped by mens ſinful deviſes, but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to catch the craftie, and intangle them in their own wiles.</p>
            <p>Being thus fallen upon this ſubject of Peace, the preſent practices on foot will require a little digreſſion in diſcourſing of it, which I ſhall the rather take libertie to do, becauſe it is the continual practiſe of this Pamphleter and others of his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171593:3"/> complices, who have his aims and ends, to buz into the peoples ears, That there are ſome who would have no peace but keep them always in war for their own ends and intereſt, the falſhood whereof I will ſtay a little upon the diſcovering in this place, that I may not be put to further trouble about it, and may prevent the miſchief intended by the often inculcating of theſe lies. In the firſt place let this be conſidered by thoſe who are apt to hearken to theſe falſe ſuggeſtions, that there is not a greater mark of a ſeditious incendiary than this, to go about to poſſeſs the people with an opinion that the Parliament would not moſt gladly put an end to their troubles by a peace ſafe for them, and their poſterity, if by any means it may be obtained; For this is to alienate the hearts of the people from the Parliament; that which is anſwered in this caſe, and accordingly made uſe of by this man, that <hi>they ſpeak not of the Parliament, but of ſome ſwaying par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the houſes of Parliament,</hi> was <hi>Oxford</hi> language long ago, when they called the Parliament Traitours, they ſaid they meant it of a ſwaying party, or faction in both houſes: I wiſh theſe who now take up their language, do not drive on their deſigns, and become the Heyfers amongſt us, with whom they at <hi>Oxford</hi> plow. But for the thing it ſelf there is not a wiſe, nor an honeſt man in either houſe that doth not deſire, indeavour and pray for a ſafe and well grounded peace. Thoſe men that are ſuch do indeed take care that the Parliament be not cheated, or forced into a peace which is neither ſafe, well grounded, nor likely therefore to continue; but onely carried on, and accommodated to the ends and advantages of particular men who affect to be eſteemed the contrivers thereof, and to enjoy the rewards of making it ſuch as may be acceptable at <hi>Oxford:</hi> This, honeſt men watch to prevent according to the truſt the people have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in them, and this is it for which they ſuffer all theſe ſlanders, calumnies, and falſe accuſations, this ſubjects them to all the envy they ly under; and we hope God in his time will ſo diſabuſe and open the eyes of the people that they ſhall clearly ſee it. A demonſtration of this, ſufficient to convince any that is not wilfully blinde, is that courſe the Parliament hath now taken to ſelect and chuſe out of the reſt of the propoſitions thoſe onely which are abſolutely neceſſary for the preſent ſettlement, and future ſecurity of the Kingdom, which if the King ſhall paſs in Bils ſent unto him, the War is at end, he may come up to his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and ſettle all other things in a Parlamentary way afterwards, Arms being laid down, and the Kingdom in peace: But if the King ſhall refuſe to do this untill he firſt come to <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> or if others ſhall refuſe to conſent to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement of a peace upon theſe Propoſitions, though they onely concern the ſafety of this Kingdom, and be by both Houſes (whoſe the judgement is) judged neceſſary thereunto, except they may intereſt themſelves in our Government, when they in the mean time require that we ſhould demand of the King for them, not onely what ever their Parliament, or Convention of Eſtates have agreed upon for their ſafety, but that he grant all ſuch further acts as they ſhall agree upon hereafter; If this ſhall fall out, let all the World judge between us, whether there be true meaning, or no, and whether it be not rather likely that there lieth ſome pad hid in the ſtraw which we ſee not. This is a diſcovering time, God hath made great diſcoveries of late, and if men would be ſo wiſe as not to be precipitated and hurried on blind-fold into ſnares and pits which they will not through prejudice ſuffer other men to keep them from falling into, they would, before it be too late (ſuſpending their judgements but for a little time)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171593:4"/> ſee the danger they are in, and be contented that wiſe men, who foreſee it ſhould deliver them out of it. To conclude this point, that I may not return to it, and as I ſaid, trouble my ſelf again with it upon every occaſion given, God doth know we would be glad of a ſafe peace, we would have the King come to the Parliament; but we would firſt provide he might ſo come, as that he might not be capable by making diviſions and factions amongſt us, and by being tempted and misled as formerly by ambitious men (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have here too many) to caſt himſelf and the Kingdom again into the ſame, or worſe troubles. And yet we would have the World to know th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We love him too well and the Crown, to ſubject either to parricidian guilt; we know what the ſucceſs of it hath been, <hi>Non gaudet tertius haeres;</hi> and we love our ſelves and the Kingdom too well to dig a pit with our own hands to bury our ſelves and our poſterity in for perpetual ſlaves. There is <hi>another</hi> we like as ill as this, and that is a <hi>totall alteration of the Government from a mixed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, duely bounded as this is, into ſomething elſe,</hi> they that fancie it and talk of it know not what themſelves; any thing ſo there be a change, though from the beſt to the worſt of all: we will none of this expedient neither, the fire is as bad and worſe than the frying pan, as we ſay: as we hate Tyranny in one, ſo we do fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in a few equals, and as much, or more confuſion in the many headed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. We reſolve therefore to keep the three eſtates co-ordinate equally to poyſe and ballance each other; and by a due interpoſition to be a juſt boundary and limit one to the other to prevent extreams. We need not, we will not, to gain a peace, be without a King, no nor without this King: Onely he himſelf hath brought this neceſſity upon us, not to truſt him with that power whereby he may do us and himſelf hurt; but with ſo much alone as ſhall be ſufficient to inable him to do us good: A mortal man as he is ſubject to failings, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with himſelf what he hath already done, might cheerfully, yea, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cloſe with his people upon theſe terms. <hi>A third</hi> is that which we ſcorn to have obtruded upon us, and I believe there is not any <hi>Engliſh</hi> heart amongſt us but riſeth againſt it, where ambition, envy, or ſome other faſcination from the Prieſts doth not byas and ſquint the mindes of men, and it is this, <hi>That if the government according to the pattern in the</hi> North <hi>may be ſet up and eſtabliſhed amongſt us for the Church; for our ancient</hi> Engliſh <hi>Government of the Kingdom ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by mutual ſtipulations and Oaths;</hi> For our Judicatories fundamental <hi>to this government, for our Laws and Liberties in and by them preſerved, we ſhall be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:171593:4"/> To meet with theſe things from Enemies is no more than we had cauſe to expect, but contrary to our expectations we have met with them alſo where we did little look for them: indeed this Agent for the <hi>Scots,</hi> throughout his whole Pamphlet, would make us believe, our Brethren came in for no other end; this was their Errant, the onely <hi>Diana,</hi> great amongſt them, this is the Cauſe of God, of the Church, and State, with ſuch like ſtuff. But we expect that they themſelves ſhould make another interpretation of our taking up Arms, which was our juſt defence in the things before ſpecified, both in reſpect to our ſelves and our poſteritie; and to aſſiſt us therein, it was that we called them into the Kingdom for; their ſecuritie in the ſame particular, depending upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending us in the Vindication of our juſt Rights, the cauſe being one &amp; the ſame, and the quarrel about it as it began with them, ſo would it certainly end in their ruin, if they ſhould ſuffer us to periſh firſt: this is their advantage, they determin and preſerve their own Right at our Charge, and ſave their own houſe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet on fire, by quenching the fire that burns their neighbours. Some paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at the late debates in the Conference about the propoſitions to be ſent to the King at the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> have been ſo ſtrange and unexpected to us to come from the Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they have called to rememberance things, before either ſlighted, or ſuſpended in mens minds, and have raiſed new jealouſies, theſe argumentations of theirs being compared with ſome former acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and late informations and discoveries. Yet we will hope the beſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no other, but confidently affirm this as the ſence of every Engliſh heart, that we will not beſtow ſuch vaſt ſums of money, and endure thoſe preſſures, which their Free-quarter and Plundering hath occaſioned in many parts of this Kingdom, to obtain an aſſiſtance from our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which ſhall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end in this, that inſtead of one ſlavery, wherein they would leave us as before, we ſhall by their means, be caſt under another as bad or worſe; That of the Prince, this of the Prieſt; and ſo purchaſe to our ſelves at ſo dear a rate this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, to become two-fold more the children of ſlaverie than before, by being made their Proſelites. We know very well who they are that compaſs Sea and Land to make theſe Proſelites, what pains they take both in Preſs and Pulpit, where they collegiate themſelves, hold their Cabals, lay their Deſigns, and iſſue out the reſults of their Conſultations, and how they deceive men otherways well affected, and make them their conduits, to convey through the whole Citie, this imbittering water, whereby they leaven and ſour the ſpirits of men againſt thoſe, to whom they ought to be moſt ſweet and indeared; the end and aym of this myſterie is not discovered by many an honeſt man who acts in it, and truly that is to be lamented, and it doth ſad the ſpirits of godly men, that even thoſe of the Miniſterie whom we believe not onely to profeſs pietie, but to be truly godly, and whom we have and do ſtill eſteem and reverence as ſuch, yet theſe ſuffer themſelves, with <hi>Barnabas,</hi> to be led into the ſame diſſimulation, not having <hi>Peter</hi> for their companion therein, which would not excuſe them, but men of a far differing ſpirit, ſuch, who if they may attain to their ends, regard not whether the means they uſe be ſuch as becometh the Miniſters of the Goſpel: how ill doth it become them who are the Meſſengers of Peace to be the occaſions of danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diviſions, how far diſtant from that ſimplicitie, which the Goſpel requires in teaching, is this practiſing with the people to ſow in them the ſeeds of Sedition by Sermons and written Diſcourſes, to the diſparagement of the Parliament,

God will certainly abaſe thoſe that are his for theſe practiſes; how much better had it been to proceed ſo far as the Magiſtrate could be convinced, and wait for what you think remaineth untill God ſhall reveal it? Certainly godlineſs had thereby been much more promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Goſpel in your Miniſtry would have had a freer paſſage and better acceptance in the mindes of men, than which nothing, not life it ſelf ſhould be dearer to you: it may be you will not believe it, but it is too true that while you ſeem to men, to preach to get power into your hands, the power of your Miniſtry is ſo weakned &amp; withered in the conſciences of men, in reſpect of what it hath formerly been, that if you deſiſt not from this teaching after an unlimited Power, and making the world believe you have turned our Zeal for Religion into a Conteſtation for the advancement of the Clergies power, as in the time of Poperie, and now amongſt them, under the name of the Church, all Religion was made but a Stalking-horſe to the ambition of Clergie men; you will ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conteſt your ſelves out of the conſciences of good men, and the power of godlineſs out of this Kingdom. Men alreadie begin to ſay, Where ſhall we go to hear Chriſt preached? others, who care not much whether they go to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or not, ſay they had rather ſtay at home than go to hear the Parliament railed upon. What I have here ſpoken of theſe of the Miniſterie, is no way ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with any deſire to disgrace Miniſters, but with a ſad heart in reſpect of thoſe of them whom I believe to be godly, deſiring from my ſoul, that they would conſider it and lay it to heart, and not involve themſelves in the guilt of other mens ambition, to the prejudice of their own Miniſteries, and to the caſting of ſtumbling-blocks and offences in the way of Gods people. This digreſſion may be of uſe at this time, and therefore born withall, ſince it is applyed to take away from this Incendiarie, the chief engine by which he works upon his ſimpler ſort, and well-meaning people, indeavouring to poyſon their affections, and incenſe them againſt the Parliament, by infuſing an opinion into them, that they intend no Peace, but an alteration of the Government, thereby to disjoyn them from the Parliament, and ſo prepare them for a conjunction which may put coercion upon the ſame; and certainly to this end, if not in the intentions of the Agents, yet in the effect of the work done, concur the practiſes of thoſe men, whoſe eyes hereby I would be glad I could open, that they might timely ſee what they are doing and invited unto, though it may be many of them go as thoſe whom <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> invited in the ſimplicitie of their hearts: But to prevent this miſchief, and to ſtop the projects and practiſes of thoſe men, who in their meetings, whiſper up and down, and make overtures privately of ſuch things as theſe whereof I have ſpoken to gain a Peace by, I have here clearly and truly expreſſed what the two Houſes of Parliament have in their intentions, as to that which concerneth the Peace of the Kingdom, which by their many Declarations and conſtant Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

            <p>But to proceed with this Pamphleter; after the man hath plaid his part to gain the credit of much zeal for the <hi>Church,</hi> as he calls it, and that without all partiality, He falls upon the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and makes his entry thus: <hi>If judgement begin at the houſe of God</hi> (that is, <hi>Scotland</hi> whereof he had ſpoken) <hi>then let England look to it,</hi> that is, where ſhall the wicked and ungodly appear?

Now againſt this abuſe and preſſure upon the ſubjects by an Arbitrarie and unlimited Power, the Parliament had reaſon according to the truſt repoſed in them, to provide; yet they ſtill offered to conſider of any other ſins that may be thought ſcandalous, if the Miniſters would preſent them, and add thoſe to ſuch as were enumerated, if they ſhould be made appear to be of that nature: and further, becauſe it was pretended, there might fall out to be emergencies ſo circumſtantiated as might make ſins ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, which could not be foreſeen, and in ſuch caſes Miniſters would be put to act againſt conſcience, untill the caſe might be brought to the Parliament, and there adjudged (for they would not directly ſeem to decline the judgement of Parliament) the Parliament appointed Commiſſioners, who upon all occaſions of emergencie might be readie to judge of them, and be at hand to State them rightly, and convey them to the Parliament as the caſe ſhould require; that ſo the ſubject might not be left without all remedie, and the Miniſters be made their own ſole Judges over them in all ſins, nay in all things, for by the old hook of the Clergie, <hi>in Ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> they would draw all under their net, this expedient was found out in their behalf, and for the more ſpeedie diſpatch of buſineſs; otherways they might, if they would, have put the Ordinance in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before, when the Appeal lay onely to the Parliament: But this expedient could not in conſcience be admitted, and the Pulpit and Preſs were both full of ſtrange language and expreſſions againſt it, when every wiſe man and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſaw clearly, that this had no one reaſon which lay againſt it, that did not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very whit as much lie againſt the Parliament it ſelf being judge, or determining in theſe caſes, onely the Parliament might be preached againſt and ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt through the ſides of theſe Commiſſioners with leſs danger and offence, than in direct terms.

The two later were, when ever they were called, for advice and counſel onely: where doth the Word of God ſhew any foot ſtep of ſuch an infallibilitie placed any where ſince the Apoſtles times, as that thereupon a Coercive power was left in any, or might by them be exerciſed over particular Churches? you muſt ſtep a ſtep higher upon this Ladder of your own framing, and ſo do ſome of your Miniſters in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and that is to an Oecumenicall Council, whereunto add your Coercion, and you will in Eccleſiaſtical matters bring in Forreign Power, and ſo fairly fall into Treaſon, which will prepare another Ladder for ſuch pragmaticks.</p>

            <p>For that of Commiſſioners in other reformed Churches, that there are none ſuch, the people are meerly abuſed therein; for there is not any Church where the people are compelled under this Power of the Miniſters, but there is either Commiſſioners, or that which is equivalent thereunto, unto whom there may be appeals, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t the Subjects be not left without remedie under the tyrannie of the Clergie, a thing which this Nation, in the greateſt height of Papal power, would never endure. In the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> it ſelf, there are Commiſſioners by name, who ſit in the Supreameſt Courts of their Eccleſiaſticall Judicatories, their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſemblies; one for the King with other Aſſeſſors, &amp; ſome for the Burrough of <hi>Eden-borough,</hi> and others for the Univerſities; who ſit and Vote even in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Excommunication, <hi>quatenus</hi> Commiſſioners. In the <hi>Palatinate</hi> the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal is to the Prince his Privie Council: In <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> no man is compelled under the power of the Presbyterie by the Magiſtrate, they exerciſe it over thoſe alone, who willingly ſubmit themſelves thereunto: theſe men, who reach after this Power here, ſhould have aſked no more of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and much good might it have done them, and they done with it. In <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> the Syndicks of that Town would not ſuffer this unlimited Arbitrarie Power to be exerciſed over the people without Appeal, notwithſtanding all that <hi>Calvin</hi> could do at firſt, neither could he, when it was referred, obtain with all his earneſt ſolicitation, the adjoyning Churches, and Magiſtrates of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Cantons, to determin for him in that caſe, that it was <hi>Jure divino,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it came near unto the Word of God; and yet in his Epiſtles it appears how much he labored to have had it ſo determined by them. The States of the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> would never endure it. The Clergie being ſick in all times of this humor, have made aſſayes every where, but could never prevail, much leſs here in <hi>England,</hi> when the blindneſs and tyrannie of Poperie was at the higheſt, as I have ſaid; and this will appear by divers Laws made in thoſe times; what they may effect in this time I know not. Commiſſioners we ſee then is no ſuch ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to other Reformed Churches, as that mens Conſciences, by reaſon of the Covenant ſhould be troubled at it, or the Pulpit crie out of it as a <hi>Monſtrum hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendum:</hi> No, this is done but, by abuſing, to ſtir up the people. For the Word of God, it is certainly conform thereunto, that the Magiſtrate ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, The people be no way oppreſſed by any Power which is called for from them, but that if they be required to ſubject the people under any power, they likewiſe judge whether that power be exerciſed over them without oppreſſion; otherwiſe they do not bear the Sword for their good, which is their office from God. The Miniſters confeſs, that in the caſe of male adminiſtration, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate may judge, and that muſt be not onely for the manner but the matter alſo, for otherwiſe a man may be Excommunicated, as the uſe was in the Biſhops times, for a Groat, or a Pig, or an Apple not paid; and the proceedings for the manner being every way regular and orderly, the Magiſtrate can give no relief, though this be an adminiſtration of ſuch a cenſure bad enough. Well then, if the Magiſtrate may judge of Excommunication, when it is ill adminiſtered, to reprove and puniſh it being done, is it not ſtrange it ſhould be held ſo great a tranſgreſſion againſt the Word, for him to judge of it before it be done, that being evil and puniſhable if it ſhould be done, it might thereby rather be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and not done at all. The truth is, reſpect to the Covenant need not to have made any mans conſcience to have ſtumbled, or been offended at Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:171593:8"/> and that is apparent enough to every wiſe man; for had that offended conſcience, the changing of Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We hear what the judgement of both Houſes is, and how earneſt their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires were for ſpeeding away the Propoſitions, that ſuch a <hi>Peace</hi> might be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as would be ſafe for the Kingdom; will our brethren, or their Commiſſioners ſay to us, Though you have fully ſatisfied your own judgements in that which concerneth your own Kingdom, for the ſetlement and peace thereof, wherein we are not to be judges, and that you are ready alſo to inſiſt upon any Propoſitions, which we ſhall judge neceſſary for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to intermeddle, or have ought to do; yet we will not agree you ſhall conclude a peace, though theſe things may be accorded and granted both to you and us: we would not willingly believe this of thoſe, who we deſire to hope, and that we may finde cauſe to believe, came into this Kingdom with fairer intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for this would be capable of no other conſtruction in the minds of all men, but that they intended we ſhould ſtill keep their Army in the Kingdom at our charge, and they keep our Towns in their hands, though there were no cauſe to be alleadged for the ſame, that any indifferent man could reſt ſatisfied withall: for though the Treaty between the two Kingdoms do require, that the one ſhall not conclude a Peace alone, and leave the other to ſhift for it ſelf (a uſual clauſe in Treaties where two States ingage in a War to defend and maintain their juſt Rights reſpectively, againſt thoſe who invade them both therein) yet doth it no way, as I have ſaid, intereſt either Kingdom in the matter of the Propoſitions of the other whereupon peace is to be made, but that as they are the proper and onely Judges of what is neceſſary for the ſafety and good Government of either Kingdom, who are of that Kingdom, and to that end aſſembled in Parliament; ſo if experience in future times ſhall make it appear, that what is now deſired
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:171593:9"/> and reſolved upon for either of the Kingdoms reſpecting themſelves, prove not to be for the ſafety and good Government thereof, they may alter and change the ſame as they ſhall finde it to be neceſſary for their ſeveral Governments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, without any dependency one upon the other in that reſpect, and will do ſo; and they who do not admit of this, by intermedling with that they have nothing to do withall, inſtead of ſetling a firm Union and laſting peace between theſe two Kingdoms, which they do ſo much pretend unto, do lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certain and continuing differences between them, which will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable; for neither Kingdom will be bound to a dependency upon the other in the Sovereign power thereof, which is the legiſlative, neither will they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear in theſe particulars which ſhall be now ſetled, to make new Laws and alter theſe, as it ſhall be found neceſſary for the ſafety and good Government of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdom: and ſo often as they ſhall ſo do, by the fooliſh Tenent of theſe men, there is the ground of a quarrel between the Kingdoms. To prevent this and clear it to all men, the Houſes before the ſending of theſe Propoſitions to the King, ſaw it fit to make this Declaration which I will here inſert.</p>

            <p>Thoſe who either do not, or will not underſtand the evil conſequences of this Tenent, That the Kingdoms now United, are mutually interreſſed in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Propoſitions of each other to be offered unto the King, and what grounds of preſent and future differences this muſt needs occaſion, finding the <hi>Treatie</hi> between the two Kingdoms will not make out what they would have herein, add the <hi>Covenant</hi> to it in ſupply, and then, when they have once named <hi>the ſolemne League and Covenant,</hi> they preſume they have proof enough for their aſſertion: Truly I ſhould be very glad, theſe men who pretend it ſo much, would intend that which might indeed conduce to the firmeſt conjunction of theſe two Kingdoms in Unity for all future ages, and that will be when they ſhall perſwade them to joyn in this alone, to obtain for either Kingdom, that which in the judgement of either reſpectively, is the juſt right thereof, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:171593:9"/> or affecting to make themſelves Judges in <hi>alienâ republicâ</hi> on either ſide; and when this ſhall be once obtained, firmly and conſtantly to adhere one to the other for the maintaining thereof; this will certainly continue an Union, becauſe their own ends and preſervation will herein continue them United; But to think to lay bounds, and put ſhakles one upon another, for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, or to take upon them to be Judges, what is fit to be aſked of the King, or fit for him to grant to either, and hereby to put themſelves into the place of Arbitrators between the King and either Kingdom, or for one of them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what ſence they pleaſe upon thoſe things which have been paſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the Parliament of the other, and pretend themſelves intereſſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to require performance agreeable to ſuch a ſenſe and Interpretation as they will put upon what hath paſſed; all this can have no other iſſue, but certain breaches and quarrels between the Kingdoms, a thing the enemy waits for: and yet either ignorantly, or wilfully (for ſome ends) theſe things have been moſt inſiſted upon, by thoſe men who would be thought moſt zealous for Union, and againſt any breach between the Kingdoms, though every wiſe man knoweth, that the preſſing and inſiſting upon theſe things muſt needs end in breaches and differences, except they hope we will leave to be <hi>Engliſh</hi> men and become their underlings: the carriage and arguments of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners, at the conference about the Propoſitions to be ſent to the King to the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> which they had nothing to do withall, nor to intermedle with, is to all that heard it, and will duely conſider it, a Demonſtration of this that I have ſaid, and what followed thereupon, confirms it. For their arguments out of theſe two words, ſolemn <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> either they are two names of one and the ſame thing; and then it is but a Covenant ſtill; or elſe they confound things that differ ſo much, to ſerve their purpoſe; for if, by the <hi>League,</hi> they will mean the <hi>Treatie</hi> between the two Kingdoms, and add that to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as if both were of the ſame kind and did bind alike in reſpect of perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed and things to be performed and challenged by them, they will find themſelves much miſtaken; for the <hi>Treatie</hi> is an obligation of the nations, one to perform to the other what is therein agreed, and the one may challenge it from the other Kingdom, as concluded by the repreſentative body of either Kingdom, the name of the Kingdom; But the <hi>Covenant</hi> is onely an Obligation of every particular man that takes it, to God, for the performance of what is therein contained, and no bond, or ſtipulation between the Nations, that they may vindicate the breach thereof one upon another; they are to leave the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of breach of Covenant to the Lord, upon any particular perſon that ſhall therein perjure himſelf: therefore Parliament men took it as particular men, not as repreſenting the Kingdom; for had that been the intention, the reſt of the Subjects needed to have been required to take it; ſo that every individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon layeth a bond upon his own conſcience, according to the ſence wherein he takes the Covenant, for which he is anſwerable to God; but this doth no way make one Kingdom anſwerable to the other for non-performance of what is contained in the Covenant, much leſs according to ſuch ſence and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as either ſhall think fit for their ends, to put upon it, and then urge the ſame upon the other; ſhould this be granted, it would miniſter to them that ſought it, ſufficient matter and grounds of quarrel between the Kingdoms; for if one Kingdom did judge men in the other did not <hi>reform their lives,</hi> as by the

            <p>I have now diſcovered the falſe grounds and rotten foundations, upon which this deceitfull worker builds and carries on his whole deſign, which is by theſe lies to poyſon the peoples affections, and to their own ruine (for that would prove the iſſue) to alienate their hearts from the Parliament, that they might be fitted to receive other Lords and Guides and ſerve their ends; a deſign as miſchievous, as the means uſed to abuſe and cheat <hi>the honeſt meaning ſimpler ſort</hi> (as he calls them) into it, are falſe and malicious: as for the Malignants and Court party, who now hold up their heads more than ever, they fall in with it readily and promote it induſtriouſly, knowing a greater advantage cannot be put into their hands, than this, whereby to attain their ends, The overthrow of this Parliament, and thereby the deſtruction of all honeſt and godly men in the Kingdom, and the ruine of the Famous Citie of <hi>London,</hi> by whoſe means prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipaly, if not onely they hope to effect what they have projected; which being done, the Citie ſhall be called to an after reckoning, for the Court will make uſe of it, to be inabled thereby to be revenged upon it, and it is like enough not ſpare the Heyfers themſelves therein wherewith they now plow, how ſcarce ſoever they for the preſent eſteem their condition to be.</p>
            <p>I expect I may fall under the cenſure, of tranſgreſſing theſe rules of making an Anſwer, by theſe long digreſſions made upon occaſion, which ſeem to be wholy of another nature; but I weigh it not at all, ſo long as I may in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:171593:10"/> obtain that which I chiefly aim at, which is to prevent the miſchief and ill conſequences of this Lie-tell Pamphlet, if credit ſhould be given unto it; to ſhew where the poyſon lies, and what will be the effect, if once it be ſwallowed; to vindicate the two Houſes of Parliament, and the honeſt men therein in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their intentions and proceedings, from thoſe lies and ſlanders which this Incendiary endeavours to caſt upon both, hoping thereby to make that go down with the multitude and ſimpler ſort more eaſily and without examination, that may ſerve his turn, and thoſe who ſet him on work: if herein I follow him not ſtep by ſtep in this his wild-gooſe chaſe, it will be becauſe I think it not worth the labour; in thoſe pieces I take in hand, I will ſhew his falſhood, malice and miſchievous practiſes, whereby thoſe who are not willing to be deceived may make a judgement of the reſt, being all <hi>Ejuſdem farinae,</hi> a bundle of Tales, ſome falſe, ſome true, but all falſely applied and made uſe of to the ſame end, to poyſon the peoples affections (as I have ſaid) and prepare them for commotions and tumultuous proceedings againſt Supream Authority. One thing more he hath before he comes to <hi>his Diſcourſe</hi> (as he terms it) which I will not omit, becauſe I cannot much differ with him in it, ſuch is our unhappineſs at preſent, and that is where he ſaith, <hi>never was good cauſe ſo ill handled, through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſome weak ones, and the malice of wicked ones;</hi> he omits an ingredient, or two, and thoſe which have greateſt operation, I will add them, and then we ſhall not differ about this matter; they are <hi>Ambition,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> wherewith ſome are ready to burſt; the truth is, theſe have caſt our affairs into ſuch a condition, what with tinckling Negotiations at Court, and our own Factions and diviſions here, that if God prevent it not, even now in the winding up of all, we are in danger to be in a worſe condition than at any times before: when we conſider what hath fallen, or broken out now of late by the practiſes of <hi>Montril</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Agent; what we finde at home, what we dayly hear from abroad; we may well reſolve, that if thoſe that are honeſt in both Kingdoms and have right aims and intentions (as I am perſwaded the generality in both have, and it is as certain there are thoſe, who what ever they pretend, are falſe in both) do not firmly Unite themſelves together, laying aſide their differences for the preſent, (which are but concerning the outſide of Religion and Liberty, and may both ſtand without what is conteſted about) that by their joynt forces they may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and diſapoint the ſecret plots and deſigns of their common Adverſaries, they are like to give themſelves up into their hands, to de laughed at firſt, and ruined afterwards; <hi>Non putarem</hi> being written upon their Tombs.</p>
            <p>All this while we have ſtayed in the <hi>porch,</hi> diſcovering the rotten foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this building, we will now go into the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and ſee what wares there are within; unraveling the pieces, and diſcovering the deceitfull working, with the falſe and rotten ground work it hath throughout the whole piece; in doing of which it may be we ſhall lay open to the view of the World <hi>ſome pieces worth obſervation,</hi> in ſtead of his counterfeit ſlips.</p>

            <p>What theſe <hi>ſiniſter Reports ſpred abroad</hi> are, we hear not; generals ſerve his turn, whoſe end is to deceive; but it is too true, there wanted not matter for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, had we been willing to ſpread them: the <hi>Letters taken in</hi> Digbies <hi>cabinet,</hi> which were not written to be intercepted, as we may ſee by the brags he makes of his care to keep them ſafe, though the King had loſt his, theſe being taken ſometime after; In one of theſe letters, written from him to <hi>Jermyne,</hi> he ſpeaks plainly of a Treatie he had with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners, he being the Kings principal Secretarie; and he is very earneſt with <hi>Jermyne,</hi> to take care, that the Queen, when ſhe ſhall leave off this Treatie between him and them, do not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrue his intentions in it, as if he would yield to any thing contrary to the directions left by her, and agreed on between her and the King; willing him to aſſure her, that the offer of this Treatie was made to him by them before ever he thought of it, and that the uſe of it ſhould be onely to abuſe them, and ſo being dexterouſly handled much advantage might be made of it: another letter from <hi>Jermyne</hi> confirmeth the ſame thing. Theſe be not <hi>Robin Hoods tales,</hi> nor <hi>Robin Wrights,</hi> nor <hi>the unknown Knights,</hi> with deſcanting upon which names you have endeavored to fence your ſelves againſt other informations come from abroad, which ſound ill enough; but ſecret intelligences, paſſing between ſuch who had no mind to deceive one another, nor could have no end in framing ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth: did we Print theſe Letters with other paſſages, and ſpread them about the Citie with <hi>Henry Elſigns</hi> name ſubſcribed? no, nor the many Letters written unto us out of the North, complaining of unheard of abuſes; nor the Reports made unto us by our Committees of Lords and Commons, who were upon the place and heard the Examinations and Proofs of thoſe horrid abuſes offered at <hi>Tickhil,</hi> and what little or no juſtice was done thereupon; nor the Proteſtation of our Committees, by which, together with thoſe of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as a joynt Committee of both Kingdoms, by the Treatie and League between the Kingdoms, the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Armie was to be ordered, when notwithſtanding that Armie in taking in of <hi>Carlile,</hi> and in marching into <hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> to that end, ſo much to the prejudice of the publick ſervice, did not onely act this without their knowledge, but contrarie to their conſent, yea, to their proteſting againſt it: Nor

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:171593:15"/> been conſtrained to go home without their Errant: they knew their ſtaying in New-Caſtle would give their friends (who abhorred the daſhing of the two Kingdoms one againſt another in a cauſeleſs War, as much as <hi>Joab</hi> did the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the King to number the people) opportunity to make their peace, and obtain their deſires much better, ſooner, and with more ſafety to them, than if by ſhewing forwardneſs to ſhed <hi>Engliſh</hi> bloud, they ſhould have incenſed them, and in ſtead of friends, made both them and the whole Kingdom real Enemies unto them; he that wrings <hi>the Noſe, will bring forth bloud:</hi> it had been too great folly for them, to fall into, to provoke this Kingdom and ingage it in earneſt againſt them; the King would have deſired no more (as he ſaith) ſo little did he, or indeed had cauſe to fear the power of the <hi>Scots,</hi> would the Nobility and Power of <hi>England</hi> have ingaged with him; but he quickly ſaw what he might expect (and what the <hi>Scots</hi> knew well enough, and did prudently, to wait for) by that Petition, which the Noble men ſent from <hi>London</hi> to him, and which was ſeconded by the deſires of the Citie and whole Kingdom. This affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to your peace, and good, manifeſted then, and afterwards without parallel, by giving you the brotherly aſſiſtance (things never to be forgotten by that Kingdom) prevented your ruine, obtained your peace upon your own terms, and made you rich; it was not any fear of your Army, which without theſe things could have effected nothing but your own hurt: I ſpeak to you Mr. Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter in the ſame perſon, you will needs at your pleaſure aſſume; you will take upon you, when you pleaſe, to perſonate the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again all the <hi>Scots,</hi> another time the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland;</hi> you ſhall Sir, at my pleaſure, ſo receive your anſwers. But what notice doth this pedant take of the Noble mens Petition? No more than of a ſign-poſt in his way, looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it onely, and rides on, though it was the very hinge upon which all our affairs for the good of both Kingdoms at that time turned about; he ſaith <hi>the incoming of the</hi> Scots <hi>gave occaſion and libertie to divers of the Nobles of</hi> England <hi>to deſire a Parliament;</hi> what effect had that? nothing? all muſt be attributed unto the <hi>Scots</hi> Army; whereas that, without this Petition, and the known ſence of the Citie and Kingdom concurring therewith, had been no more, than the fly upon the wheel; and yet he will needs mark the granting of the Parliament, and the continuance of it, to be done by the King for fear of the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the preſervation thereof alſo from total deſtruction and ruine muſt be put in to ſet forth the merit, and magnifie the great works done by that Army; a fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery ſo ridiculous, as is ſufficient of it ſelf to diſcover this Agent for the <hi>Scots,</hi> and his work in this Pamphlet to all knowing men: what the deeds of that Army were, which he attributes our preſervation unto, I ſhall ſhew hereafter; in the mean time ſee the impudency of this ſpatterer, in caſting durt upon thoſe Noble men, whom poſterity hath cauſe to honour to all generations, and that they might have this honour, in the beginning of this Parliament the Houſe of Peers publickly gave them thanks, and appointed withall, that their names ſhould be entered upon record in their Journal book, with their thanks given unto them, as an acknowledgement of the ſervice they had done the Kingdom by that act of theirs? This fellow makes no other uſe of it than to magnifie the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, and aſperſe thoſe Noble men, of whom he ſaith ſome have betrayed the cauſe of God and his people, what by open War, and what by clandeſtine undermining; thoſe, who by open War have oppoſed the Parliament are known, and let them
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:171593:16"/> bear their ſhame; but for the other aſperſion of clandeſtine undermining, it is applicable to any of them being left uncertain, and therefore none of them are free from it; The man hath evil thoughts againſt ſome of whom he can ſpeak no ill, for if he could, you ſhould be ſure to have it; it is a ſecret, that, the truth is, he himſelf was never acquainted withall, onely he hath ſo little charity as to make himſelf a Judge out of his own evil thoughts, and would very willingly have other men do ſo to, hoping they may fix upon thoſe perſons his malice would render ſuſpected, whoſe worth dazels his eyes, and ſtirs his ſpleen the more, becauſe he findes the conſtant integrity of their carriage to be ſuch that it muzzes up his ſoul mouth.</p>

I have been willing upon this occaſion to inſiſt a little upon this particular, of the two Houſes of Parliament taking up of Arms, not onely to ſtate the cauſe and quarrel aright, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not by this Pamphletter, and thoſe who ſet him on work, be abuſed, and miſled into miſtakes of it, as afterwards you ſhall ſee he indeavours, but alſo that I might open and clear to others (who are ſtrangers to our affairs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, in theſe late unhappy Wars, and its probable to the Government of this Kingdom in the right &amp; true conſtitution of it) the neceſſity that the Houſes of Parliament had to do it, and the Juſtice that there was in that which they did; leaſt being deceived by the Court party, &amp; ſuch Remonſtrances and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations as have been ſet forth to that end, they may misjudge the Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and think they roſe up diſobediently againſt Authority, when they maintained and defended the lawfull Authority of this Kingdom againſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and manifeſt oppreſſion, by which otherwiſe it had been ſubverted: ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of other Nations, ignorant of this Government, may eaſily be led into ſuch an errour, and therefore I thought it my part and duty, to take this occaſion to vindicate the honour, integrity and juſtice of the two Houſes of Parliament in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:171593:18"/> that action, at that time, and upon that occaſion done by them: what hath been done by others ſince without them, yea againſt them, can with no juſtice be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them.</p>
            <p>The man, before he was aware, ſtates the quarrel right, the King makes open War, with intent to deſtroy the Parliament, they are forced to take up Arms to defend and preſerve themſelves, and in them the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtroyed; and what they took up Arms for, that they called their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Scotland</hi> to aſſiſt them in: I believe this Zelot will finde ſome of his ends contained in the Covenant, as he would have it believed, and ſo often there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inculcates it, wanting in thus ſtating the quarrel; he would have that, which he calls <hi>the Reformation of Religion,</hi> the thing we fight for, and therefore batters the peoples ears, almoſt in every leaf, <hi>with ſtanding for the cauſe of God, the ſervice of the Church, the ends contained in the Covenant, promoting the cauſe of the Church,</hi> and ſuch like; but what is all this in his intention? Nothing elſe but the caſting out of Biſhops, and ſetting up in <hi>England</hi> the Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> this with him is Religion from top to toe, head to foot, whereas were it what it ought to be, and what they would have it believed to be, it is ſo far from that, that it is but the ſhell to the kernel, the utmoſt mound Wall to the Temple, the Pins to the Tabernacle. Could he ſay, and make it good, the Kings deſign was, to make open War to alter the Laws eſtabliſhed concerning Religion here in <hi>England,</hi> and by force to bring in Popery againſt Law, he might well make it a part of the quarrel, and think and ſay, we ought to defend Religion eſtabliſhed by Law, againſt idolatry, by oppoſing force to force (I mean the two Houſes of Parliament, and ſo would alwayes be underſtood in this caſe of taking up of Arms in defence of the Laws, and oppoſing force with force, not of private men when I ſay <hi>we</hi>) but men will eaſily perceive, except they be ſome of thoſe, you ſo often call <hi>your ſimpler ſort,</hi> how great a difference there is between fighting to maintain the Laws and true Religion eſtabliſhed by them againſt idolatry; and fighting againſt Law to overthrow one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereby eſtabliſhed, and ſet up another in the Church, which hath no Law for it; when true Religion may ſtand, though both thoſe ſhould fall; neither the one, as you have framed it, and uſe it, no more than the other, being better than a meer humane policie. You, and thoſe who ſet you on work, ſhall give us leave to ſtate our own cauſe; in aſſiſting us you muſt take up what we avow; if you have any thing elſe of your own to promote, you may be left to abound in your own ſence, and do it in your own Kingdom, and anſwer therein your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: but <hi>you often urge, we are bound to make good the ends contained in the Covenant, and that your Nation would not ingage, untill that Covenant was framed, and entered into;</hi> and from hence you would infer, that <hi>Reformation of Church-Government, according to</hi> that ſence you put upon <hi>the Covenant,</hi> to ſerve your turn, <hi>is that we are bound to contend and fight for:</hi> you are out of the way, a thing uſual with you; we do acknowledge the entering into a Covenant was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, for that muſt not be wanting with you when you undertake things of this nature, and to give you ſatisfaction it was agreed unto by us, and laſtly framed here in <hi>England,</hi> but with theſe limitations purpoſely <hi>(according to our place and calling:)</hi> we would have you prove, that we are in our place, when we are in Arms, to force the alteration of Laws already made, or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of new; or ſhew us what calling we have to take up Arms, having
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:171593:19"/> no other cauſe but this alone for it: it is true, as hath been proved, that we have juſt cauſe to take up Arms to defend the Government and Laws of the Kingdom, and our ſelves in the defence thereof, from violence, Arms being taken up firſt, as you affirm, to deſtroy us: the Reformation of theſe abuſes in the Church, and preventing the diſturbance of peace in the Civil Government, occaſioned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, through the never failing p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is your addition to the Covenant, there being no ſuch word in it, we finde your ſkill in Addition and Subſtraction when it ſerves for your turn, all your Pamphlet over, wherein you ſhew little pity, or ſkill therein, ſo far as theſe Reformed Churches make the word of God their pattern and example; <hi>follow me,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>as you ſee me follow Chriſt:</hi> otherwiſe we have nothing to do with your example, or theirs: we ſhall alſo keep to our Covenant <hi>for the extirpating of all Sects, Schiſms and Hereſies, according to the word of God;</hi> which as it was particularly explained at the debate that was at the framing of the Covenant, is to be underſtood, not onely in reſpect of the errours themſelves, which are to be tried and examined by the word of God, but of the proceedings to be had with thoſe perſons, who ſhall be found to hold ſuch errours, which proceedings alſo muſt be according to the rules of the word of God; not preſently to call for fire to come down from Heaven and conſume them, this fiery Zeal from the fleſh, not from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, this will pull up Wheat, inſtead of Tares; but what the Spirit of Chriſt (for theſe men know not of what Spirit they are) doth in his word direct to be done with ſuch perſons as being corrupted in judgement, indeavour to corrupt others, and diſturb the peace of the Church and of the ſtate (for that will unavoydably follow) and cauſe rents and diviſions in both; we according to theſe rules, ſhall keep to our Covenant in dealing with ſuch, as faithfully and ſincerely as any hot head of them all. Thus much upon this occaſion, for ſtating the quarrel, aright, before we follow the man in his ſtory of carrying on this quarrel which was taken up againſt us, and hath been proſecuted with ſo much violence, practiſe and falſhood of all kindes; we would not have the people abuſed and drawn into a miſtake in that point, what it was, we took up Arms for, and do juſtifie, we may and muſt fight for, by his continual pratling of <hi>the holy League and Covenant,</hi> as if all things contained therein were the ground, and had been the cauſe of this quarrel; we ſhall not fight I think if whoring, ſwearing, juggling, falſe dealing, drunkenneſs, and other abominable prophane practiſes open and ſecret be not reformed in our lives and converſations; and yet we are as much bound by the Covenant to do this, and ſee it done, as to reform thoſe things this Pamphleter cries out ſo much for, and doth ſo frequently buze into the peoples ears: I would it might pleaſe God to work mens hearts to a through repentance for theſe, you ſhould not need then to trouble your ſelf much for the other you are ſo zealous againſt, for they would quickly fall away of themſelves, being the juſt judgements and puniſhments ſent of God for the forenamed abominations, <hi>he ſends upon men ſtrong deluſions becauſe they receive not the truth in the love thereof,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:171593:19"/> but delight in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> they <hi>have a ſhew of godlineſs,</hi> but in their lives and converſations with men, <hi>they denie the power of it:</hi> This makes ſome run into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable errors on the one hand, and others turn bloudie perſecutors on the other hand, both receiving the juſt reward of their hypociſie.</p>
            <p>But before I paſs on further I will aſk you one queſtion, and it is this, by what rule ſhall we know them, whom you call by the name of <hi>Independents, Sectaries, Schiſmaticks, and Hereticks,</hi> againſt whom you would have the people believe your bow is bent, and your arrows ſharpened; and the perſecution of whom is, with you, the cauſe of God, and the end contained in your Covenant? I ſuppoſe you will not ſay thoſe who in Doctrine and Diſcipline refuſe to conform to what you and yours have ſet up in your fancies, and call the Cauſe of God, and the good work in hand, the ſettling of the Church and ſuch like? this were too groſs; I expect, if you be urged, you will rather ſay, you mean ſuch as refuſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable in Doctrine and Diſcipline to the Word of God; but what it is, that the Word of God doth hold forth concerning theſe, muſt be agreed upon by that Church and State where ſuch men live, whom you would have branded with theſe names; otherwiſe if no Rule be ſet, how can there be a Separation from it? or the word Sectarie, or Heretick imputed to one man more than to another? Now if we examin, when this Pamphleter did write, what it was that was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed here by the State and Church of <hi>England,</hi> it will be found to have been <hi>Epiſcopacie</hi> and the <hi>Service-book;</hi> are not your fierceſt Presbyterians then as great Separiſts, Sectaries, and Schiſmaticks, as Independents? for I hope they will now pretend themſelves to be as oppoſite to theſe, as your greateſt Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; what ever they were in the Biſhops times, and what they did then, the moſt of them we know well enough; At this time ſince the State hath agreed upon the <hi>Directorie,</hi> and that Government, which they think fit and meet to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle here in this Kingdom for the Churches thereof, is there an Independent, nay a Schiſmatick, Sectarie, or Heretick amongſt them all, that will not conform to it as fully as any Preſbyterian, with that <hi>Explanation</hi> and <hi>Reſervation</hi> which the Preſbyterians in plain terms tell the Parliament they will take to themſelves in conforming, and conform no further? they have had the confidence to give in papers, or at leaſt to print and ſpread about papers to this purpoſe, a Copie whereof you ſhall here ſee; and let the ſame libertie be given to Independents or to the worſt of Hereticks (which this Pamphleter and others to the disgrace of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches amongſt forreign Nations, would make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we ſwarm withall) and there is none ſuch amongſt us who will not be as conformable as any of thoſe who by a rigid preſſing of Conformitie to their own wills and fancies, overthrow that unitie in what is the known will of God, which otherwiſe might be carried on in love according to the Apoſtles rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. and 3.16. notwithſtanding difference of judgement in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars not deſtructive to the foundation of Chriſtian Religion.</p>

                  <p>We have ſeriouſly pondered the preſent ſtate of things; and find our ſelves, whether we act as is required, or act not, to be in a very great ſtrait. On the one hand, Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, being justly pulled down, and the Church miſerably groaning under Disorder &amp; Confuſion, many things crie aloud upon us in our places to put Church Government into actual execution; The glory of God, the edification of his Church, the Dutie of our Function, the Ingagement of our ſolemn Covenant with God, the command of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate (which ſo far as we can with a good Conſcience, we are reſolved and hold it our Dutie to obey,) and the preſent unſpeakable miſeries of the Church by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Diviſions, Blaſphemies, Hereſies, abominable Looſeneſs, Libertiniſm, and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, and the ſpiritual Ruin of many Congregations through falſe Teachers, or want of faithfull Paſtors for lack of Ordination. On the other hand, upon conſideration of all the Ordinances of <hi>Parliament</hi> about Church-Government, we find many neceſſarie things not yet eſtabliſhed, and ſome things wherein our Conſciences are not ſo full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: And therefore in our beginning to act, we cannot but foreſee, how likely we are to be ſiniſterly interpreted by many, who are prone to misconstrue all our actions of this nature. We thereupon hold it neceſſarie to expreſs upon what Grounds we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, to act upon the Ordinances alreadie eſtabliſhed by Authoritie.</p>
                  <p>Although we conceive the power of Church-cenſures, and in particular the keeping off Ignorant and Scandalous perſons from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, to be in Church-Officers by the Will and Appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, and from him they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Office and Authoritie: Yet we acknowledge, it belongs to the Magistrate to have his Conſcience ſatisfied in the truth of that Government of the Church which he will ſet up by his Authoritie, from whom the Church Officers do receive Authoritie of the publick exerciſe of their Offices in his Dominions. And in caſe the Magiſtrate be not ſo fully informed, as to ſet up a right and perfect Rule in every particular, the Church Officers may yet act under that Rule; Provided, that they do not ſubſcribe to, or otherwiſe acknowledge that Rule to be intire and right in all points.</p>
                  <p>And therefore for theſe particular Ordinances, although we humbly conceive that they do not hold forth a compleat Rule, nor are in all points ſatisfactorie to our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: Yet becauſe we find many things eſtabliſhed in them, agreeable to the Word of God (for which we deſire heartily to bleſs God, and to be thankfull to the Honorable Houſes,) Proviſion being made for inabling the Elderſhips by their Authoritie, to keep
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:171593:20"/> away from the Lords Supper all Ignorant perſons, and many Scandalous perſons, with a Declaration of their Reſolution, that all Notorious and Scandalous Offenders ſhall be kept from the Sacrament, and that there ſhall be a further addition to the Scandalous offences formerly enumerated; We conceive it is our dutie to begin to act in reference to Church-Government by Congregational, Claſsical, Provincial, and National Aſſemblies; <hi>Reſolving by the Grace of God to walk in all things according to the Rule of the Word, and according to theſe Ordinances ſo far as we conceive them correſpondent to it;</hi> and to be accountable to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate whenſoever he ſhall call us thereunto; Hoping ſo to carry our ſelves, as not onely to injoy his concurrence with us on all occaſions; but alſo that he will ſupply what is lacking to make the Government intire, and likewiſe make alterations in all things that ſhall appear to be amiſs. And in thus doing, we truſt we ſhall not grieve the ſpirits of the truly godly either at home or abroad; nor give any juſt occaſion to them that are contrarie minded, to blame our proceedings.</p>

            <p>The man means not to be thus turned off the ſtage, no, he will inſtance in particulars, <hi>the North</hi> he ſaith <hi>was all loſt but</hi> Hull, <hi>the Weſt alſo almoſt altogether gone by the loſs of</hi> Exceter, <hi>the defeat at the</hi> Devizes, <hi>and the baſe ſurrender of</hi> Briſtol <hi>and</hi> Banbury: by giving it this Epithite, and placing his Emphaſis there, you may know the Gentlemans diſeaſe, he is ſick of the overflowing of the Gaul, and therefore takes a Pill of Preſbyterian Spleen (otherwiſe called Zeal by them) to eaſe his ſtomack, and up comes all, though never ſo falſe; this ingredient is ſo quick and ſtrong in working, that it will turn the ſtomack many times, the more is the pitie, though it be in the Pulpit. I write it not to diſgrace thoſe men who are for Presbytery in their judgements, many of whom I love and reverence as Godly men; but to bring ſuch of them, whoſe apparent known malice, envy, and uncharitableneſs, together with a buſie and pragmatical exerciſe of theſe vices, they uſe to cover over with this pretence and title of Zeal for the cauſe of God, to ſee, and repent for that ſcandal, they hereby caſt upon the Goſpel and the profeſſion thereof in the eyes of prophane men, as may be ſeen in this man throughout this whole Paper project of his, which is compiled to ſlander, and traduce moſt falſly well deſerving men, wherein no difference of times, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place ſtops the operation of his ſpleen and malice, as we may here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, Eaſt ſhall rather be made Weſt; for what hath <hi>Banbury</hi> to do with the loſs of the Weſt, or the ſurrender of that (had any ſuch thing been) with the ſurrender of <hi>Briſtol</hi> either in time, or place? But that he might vomit up that poyſonfull humour (which as appears all along his ſtomack is full of) upon thoſe who did more, and ſuffered more for his Countrey-men in the beginning of their troubles, than all thoſe whom he flatters, fawns upon, and gives titles to; yea, at that time when ſome of thoſe were in Arms againſt them: this groſs lie is dragged in, and tied together with the reſt, as we uſe to ſay with points. We hear him often talking of an ingagement by Covenant, he might remember who it was that ſtopped a general ingagement of this whole Kingdom by an Oath, framed and tendered to that purpoſe at <hi>York</hi> againſt the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation, when they were firſt to have been invaded. He knows not, it may be, in the broken Parliament when the King indeavoured more to ingage the Parliament to aſſiſt him againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> (whom he then ſtiled Rebels) by the grant of mony to that end, then to get the mony, the Gentleman whom he here ſpits his venom at, though but a young Parliament man then, was the firſt that made that motion, <hi>That if any mony were granted, it ſhould be with a Declaration of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that they would not have it imployed againſt their brethren of</hi> Scotland; which being approved of by the Houſe, the King hearing of their intention to make ſuch a Declaration, choſe rather to break up the Parliament and be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mony, than have the giving of it ſo accompanied: gratitude doth not grow in the Gardens and grounds of theſe men: <hi>Omnia dixeris cum Ingratum dixeris.</hi>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:171593:23"/> is blind, ſtark blind on the one ſide, and therefore had this Gentleman gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Boat, and left the Town to ſhift for it ſelf without defending of it at all, or making any conditions for it, when all the ſtrength of his Garriſon was broken at the <hi>Devizes,</hi> being left by Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> and his horſe, who run away, while they ſtood firm together in a bodie, being 2000 Foot, a long time after, and thereupon, every man leaving him in <hi>Bristol</hi> for loſt (as Mr. <hi>John Aſh</hi> firſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his Letter to the Council of War, and after before them upon Oath, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf at the time been an eye witneſs of what he depoſed) ſurely he had done very worthily, and no way baſely; provided he would afterwards (whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he had done before) have complied fully with the partie who went accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ends contained in the ſolemn League and Covenant, which what it means we cannot be ignorant of: but ſince he was not of that baſe temper, to make a Covenant a pretence to hold up a Faction, and drive on a Deſign, it muſt be baſely done in him, to hold a Town of 4 miles line in Circuit, a ſtorm ſo long, that 1200 of the Enemies men were killed, 40 Officers, 4 Colonels, and ſome chief Gentlemen of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> when he had (except ſome raw men ſuddenly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up and armed) but 700 of his Garriſon left, 7000 being few enough to keep that place, for 5 days was all the time he had, before not onely that Army which beat our Forces at the <hi>Devizes,</hi> and there brake the ſtrength of his Garriſon, but Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> with forces from <hi>Oxford,</hi> joyned with them, came up to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege him, preſently, upon the discouragement that our flying Forces brought into the Citie; he had not ſo much powder left as had been ſpent in the time they ſtormed, wherein the Enemie was often beat off with ſo much loſs; for Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig</hi> were ſo ill provided of Ammunition for their Armie, that he was neceſſitated to ſupply them out of his Stores therewith, as well as with 1200 of his beſt Souldiers, which they both earneſtly preſſing him to do, when they wrote unto him for it, uſed this Argument, That if they were beaten in the Field, it was in vain for him to think he could defend the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie though all his Garriſon remained with him, this was their ſence and writing then, however they carried themſelves afterwards; and his Council of War being called, to whom he put that very queſtion, reſolved the ſame, where were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent many Gentlemen of the Countrey and Townſmen, and this he did before he would ſend out a man; yet to defend the place being left in ſuch a condition, even after the Line was entered, and the Suburbs poſſeſſed, until he had made as good or better conditions, both for the Souldiers, Townſmen, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Town, who were friends to the Parliament, than Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> did when he ſurrendered it again: This is the buſineſs which this pedantical fellow aſperſeth him withall; the malicious falſhood whereof will more appear by the conſideration of that difference that there was when the place was ſurrendered the firſt, and ſecond time; which in reſpect of the Fortifications (a Royal Fort being added) was much ſtronger than that Town could be made, whereas before it had onely an old rotten Caſtle, as Mr. <hi>Hodges</hi> teſtified, not able to bear the discharging of the Ordinances that were upon it, and which, as <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſaid, he would lay his life was not tenable 24 hours after the Line entered: In reſpect of the work, at firſt it was rather an intrenchment haſtily caſt up about the Town, and that not finiſhed for want of time, but where the Line was entered, left unperfected, than a Fortification that ſuch a place required, but when Retaken, made as ſtrong as that place could be made to make it tenable; the Works then

But that it may appear to the world how baſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and unworthily this Gentleman was dealt withall in this buſineſs, I will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſome of the carriages of this myſterie of iniquitie, which I have learned, all of them I believe are not known but to themſelves, &amp; kept amongſt themſelves, who were the proſecutors and actors therein: I ſhall therefore deſire the reader in the firſt place to take notice of a falſhood continually obtruded, when the malice of theſe men ſpits out their venom againſt this Gentleman upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and that is, <hi>that he was called in queſtion for it at a Council of War,</hi> this to men who know not the carriage of this buſineſs for the preſent, much more will it do ſo to poſteritie hereafter (to whom they deſire to tranſmit this ſlander, knowing that they are likely to be ignorant of what now juſtifieth him) holdeth forth as if the General, or Parliament were ſo unſatisfied with his rendition of that place upon the terms it was yielded, that they called him in queſtion for it, &amp; put him upon trial by that Council of War, which had the will to condemn him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the truth is, when he gave an account of it firſt to the Committee of Safetie, when he came up, afterwards to the Parliament, then to the General, they all reſted ſatisfied in it: onely he himſelf, out of the knowledge of his own integritie in that action, and that he had done what could be done by a man left in that condition, not able to bear the bawlings of ſome men who had ſuffered loſs, and the malice of others, who running away themſelves, were as readie as any to caſt blame upon him to hide their own ſhame, and therefore joyned with thoſe who ſpake and wrote to his disgrace, though contrarie to their own knowledge and hand writing formerly, as was made appear at the Trial; he, I ſay, upon this, indiſcreetly and unwiſely caſts himſelf into the hands of his enemies, gave them the occaſion their malice and envie waited for, by not reſting to importune the General by himſelf, and his friends; and having gotten his conſent to intreat of the Houſe of Commons (whereof he was a Member) that he might be cleared at a Council of War, whereunto he deſired he might be referred, and obtained it onely by his own importunitie; ſo far was it from that which is conſtantly and moſt falſely by them affirmed, that he was called in queſtion for it by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Parliament, and by them brought to trial at a Council of war: of which Council of War, how they were compoſed and fitted, and how they acted, have patience to hear a little: When this Gentleman had procured by his endeavours for his vindication to have a Council of War to hear this buſineſs, the two <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thams,</hi> Father and Son having friends near the General that could do much with him, they moved the General and obtained it, that Summons might be ſent to the <hi>Hothams,</hi> Father and Son to be tried at the ſame time, and a Council of War was fitted for that purpoſe; now though in the General, and in that friend of theirs who put the General upon this, there was not an intention to prejudice
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:171593:24"/> this Gentleman, but onely to ſave the <hi>Hothams;</hi> and it is probable, had that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign taken, they had quitted all, hoping the clearneſs of this caſe might have made the other paſs with it the more eaſily; yet in the thing it ſelf there was much to his prejudice, firſt in reputation, that he ſhould be put (as hereby it would ſeem to the world) into an equal condition with thoſe whom all know to be guiltie and impriſoned for the ſame, ſeeking this Trial onely to eſcape that which they knew the Parliament would bring them unto, as afterwards they did; Secondly, had this Plot taken and all been acquitted, his acquitting with ſuch companie would have blemiſhed him, and been cried out of notwithſtanding his own clearneſs; but that failing, the Parliament prohibiting their trial at that time, well enough perceiving the deſign; the Council of War choſen for their ſafetie, were men fitted for his ruine, both in their diſpoſitions and affections, many of them toward him and his friends; and the rather now being irritated by failing of their deſign in reſpect of the other two; in ſo much that Sir <hi>William Balfore,</hi> a known able Commander of great experience in the Wars as any, if not before any in theſe Kingdoms, who not onely cleared him, but ſaid, if it had been in any other Kingdom he would have been ſo far from being condemned for that ſervice he had done, that he would have been rewarded rather, he knew what belonged to War, and what grounds Counſels of War ſhould go upon in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and acquitting (the greater part of the reſt it is likely never ſat in a Council of War before) he being by his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I do not without ground call it <hi>predetermined,</hi> for before ever he was heard to ſpeak in his own defence, or any word ſpoken againſt him, a Member of the Houſe of Commons came to him, who was ſo intimate with this good Council of War, that he knew their intentions, and thereupon adviſed him not to truſt to his in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:171593:25"/> of the Council of War were reſolved already to condemne him; an excellent major part of a Council of War, and well prepared for the purpoſe, as by this you may ſee: it was indeed carried, but by a major part who were reſolved as it ſeems by this Gentleman, before hand (the Lawyer might have ſpared his railing, and his declamations of 3 or 4 hours length, till many that heard him fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep; the reſt, who came not reſolved, were ſatisfied with what they heard and did acquit him thereupon.) I can name the Gentleman, or Knight rather, but without his conſent, I will not, leaſt I make his friends who communicated their ſecrets to him, angry with him for it. Notwithſtanding things thus fitted and prepared, when he was heard to ſpeak for himſelf and the proofs and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies produced, which ſhewed his condition and his carriage therein; <hi>Holborn</hi> and <hi>Ennis,</hi> and another <hi>Scots</hi> Officer who was afterwards killed near <hi>Woodstock,</hi> and who at the time he heard it, deteſte, das he profeſſed to Major <hi>Holms</hi> his Countrey-man, that a deſerving Gentleman ſhould be ſo wronged, theſe being Souldiers and not of the Caball, began to ſay that they could not condemn him, and therefore had acquitted him with the reſt, but for the practiſe uſed by thoſe, who had reſolved what they would do in it; and had theſe fallen off, though they had continued ſtill the major part, yet it would have much blaſted the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, they being accounted Souldiers of another degree and ſtanding, than the other whom I need not name: hereupon they ſaw it neceſſary to put off the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their Judgements in it for a week, which the Preſident did accordingly, in which time the buſineſs with theſe men was wrought about. <hi>Holburn</hi> and <hi>Ennis</hi> were dealt withall, and dyning with the Lord <hi>Robert,</hi> who was Preſident, <hi>Holburn</hi> was heard to ſay they could not finde any thing that might give a juſt ground to condemne him for his carriage in that buſineſs, to which the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, they muſt however condemne him for example ſake, this being the firſt, leaſt others ſhould be incouraged to give up Towns when there was no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that there would be no danger in it to him, for they were ſure the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral would pardon him: an excellent piece of Juſtice, a Gentlemans life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour muſt be caſt away, who was in no fault, as they themſelves knew and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, for fear others might commit faults afterwards. The Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, was heard alſo to tell the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> that <hi>Holburn</hi> did ſay to him, Col. <hi>Fienne</hi> was in no fault, but becauſe he would not lay it upon his Officers, the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, he muſt bear it himſelf; this I know to be true, for I heard it ſpoken my ſelf: good Juſtice ſtill, it ſeems <hi>Roberts</hi> diſcourſe prevailed. Cannot a Town left in that condition, and without hope of relief, be ſurrendred upon ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as this was, and yet neither Governour nor Officer to blame? or if Officers be to blame, they ſhould be called to account for it; and not a man condemned that they knew had done his duty, and was no way faulty: yet he did at the time accuſe ſome Officers, who refuſed to obey commands, but it was not <hi>Langrige</hi> whom they aimed at, and would have had him charge. By all this it appears, what difficulties they were put upon, to effect and bring about this buſineſs; at laſt they finde out the Article <hi>of not holding out to the utmoſt extremity,</hi> to do the feat, for as for treachery they cleared him; for Cowardize they could object no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but forſooth he did not hold it out to the utmoſt extremity, when there were five particulars all concurring in his caſe and condition, either of which ſingly of it ſelf, if it can be truly alleadged and ſufficiently proved, as in this caſe all the five were, is to be accounted, and would have been, and were ſo
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:171593:25"/> by thoſe who underſtood, the grounds a Council of War ſhould proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a holding out to utmoſt extreamity, and in which caſes, if a Governour ſhall neglect and omit to make the beſt conditions he can for himſelf and thoſe that are with him, he is worthy to be queſtioned and cenſured for it. Want of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, want of men to man the Line, and many of thoſe that were, laying down Arms, and deſerting their Colours, ſo that not above five, or ſix in ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies could be gotten together, as the Captains affirmed, and upon promiſe of preſent mony to be given unto them by himſelf, of the 1700 which were all he had, or could in that time of five dayes make up his broken Garriſon unto, he could not get together above ſix-ſcore, when the Line was entered and the Suburbs; again theſe being entered, there was no Intrenchment defencible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and moſt of all conſiderable, though laſt mentioned, an aſſurance that he could not be relieved, and this from the General himſelf as hath been ſhewed. Now ſo ſoon as they had done this in this unworthy manner, leſt ſome of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves might fall into the Net they had contrived to catch this Gentleman in, they think it neceſſary to explain the Articles of holding out to utmoſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and explain it thus, that if it be proved the Souldiers refuſed to fight, it ſhall be interpreted to be a holding out to the utmoſt extreamity; and this they did preſently after the Trial, though in his caſe it prevailed not, being fully proved by divers witneſſes, eſpecially thoſe Souldiers that were Townſ-men newly raiſed after the loſs of his own Souldiers at the <hi>Devizes,</hi> being ſhop keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and fearing the Town would be taken, laid down their Arms and would not be ſeen, nor come to their Colours, but deſerted him: could there be a more manifeſt conviction of themſelves in reſpect of this unjuſt ſentence, than this that was done upon the inſtant by themſelves? But the giving up of <hi>Gainsbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> when ſuccours were at hand; and the quitting of <hi>Lincoln</hi> with all the Or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinance and Ammunition left in it, when no Enemy was in ſight, nor within ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miles of it (both by the Lord <hi>Willowby</hi> a Chief man in that Councill of War) where there was neither extreamity, nor nothing like a ſiege, and this being done before, made them make this hole in their Net, ſo ſoon as they had uſed it, to ſerve their preſent turn: for he could onely alleadge for himſelf, as he did, that <hi>his Souldiers told him, they would not fight,</hi> but whether they would be as bad as their words, or no, he reſolved to truſt them, for he never ſtaid to trie them, but left the Town and all that was in it, upon a report of the Enemies being at, or about <hi>Newwark,</hi> many miles from thence; here was <hi>a holding out to the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie,</hi> by one of the Chief and active Judges in this Council of War; it was time to make an explanation: but, as I have ſaid, how palpable a conviction of themſelves, and this unjuſt practiſe, it was, to do it preſently upon the wrong they had done this Gentleman, let the World judge, eſpecialy when this in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular was ſo fully proved before them in his caſe. If I follow another (who was a Chief Agent and contriver in this buſineſs) into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> I ſhall ſhew, how this unjuſt ſentence, by Gods juſt judgement, followed him, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him much more juſtly in all mens judgements, or make him condemne himſelf, for giving and drawing others to joyn with him in this unjuſt ſentence upon no ground. When the Army went into the <hi>Weſt</hi> (after the Kings going out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> with ſuch Horſe and mounted Muſketiers, as he could make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that he might not be beſieged) the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> was made Lord Marſhall of the Field, that thereby there might be a reconciliation wrought between him
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:171593:26"/> and the General, for before they were upon no good terms: the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> is a man of good parts, and he knoweth it, therefore he uſeth to think his reaſons too valid and ſtrong to be contradicted by any, he muſt bear the ſway and rule all, or elſe he will make a party whereof he will be the head: Friends to them both knowing this, and the General finding it by experience in the Army, they perſwade the General to uſe this expedient to make him his, and draw him off from any other parties; but this being done, the General muſt ſo far be at his diſpoſe, as not to contradict him, but be ruled by him: as they marched into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> they underſtood, the King, with that force of Horſe, and mounted Muſke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers he had with him, being a very conſiderable ſtrength, turned into the <hi>Weſt</hi> alſo, to joyn the Forces he had with him with the Weſtern Army under <hi>Hopton,</hi> which was then the greateſt ſtrength he had in <hi>England,</hi> and would be made much ſtronger by the addition of ſo many Horſe and 2000 mounted Muſketiers; upon this advertiſement it was debated at a Council of War, whether it were not beſt for the General with his Army to interpoſe between theſe two, and hinder their conjunction before he proceeded farther <hi>Weſtward,</hi> a thing the King moſt feared, his Horſe being laggered out and tired, and having neither Foot nor Artillery with him, and the Generals Army being a brave Army, fully furniſhed with all theſe; it was reſolved by the major part of that Council of War, <hi>that it was fit for the Army to fight the Kings Forces,</hi> which they might have done with great advantage, and not ſuffered them to joyn with the other Army in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and indeed it ſtood with all reaſon ſo to adviſe; But the Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> now Lord Marſhal of the Field, was of another opinion, and that muſt be yielded unto, though the greater number of the Council of War oppoſed him in it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the former; hereupon the Army was drawn into <hi>Cornwall</hi> with ſuch haſte, and ſo improvidently, that they took not ſo much care, as to make good the paſſes behind them, whereby they might ſafely make their retreat if need were, or have ſuccours and proviſions ſent them, being drawn into the moſt Malignant County to them in <hi>England;</hi> and the King hereby alſo had means without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to joyn all thoſe Forces be brought with him, to his <hi>Weſtern</hi> Army: this gave great diſcontent to the Army, and cauſed many to ſpeak very hardly of the Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> as if he had brought the Army into all that danger, to ſecure his own Houſes, and Lands, that lay there about, and to be a Convoy for Treaſure, he had there, being concealed; but this might proceed onely out of their diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, being exaſperated to finde themſelves brought into ſuch a pinfold by his means, in prevailing with the General, contrary to what was adviſed by the greater part of the Council of War: However this was, or what were the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, all the World knoweth what the iſſue was, the Army being brought into difficulties for want of proviſions, partly by the malignancy of that Countrey, and eſpecially by the great ſtrength of Horſe, which the Enemy had by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings Horſe to the former Army (which ſhould and might eaſily have been prevented) whereby they kept the paſſes, which we might have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and thereby kept all proviſions from the Army, ſo that the Horſe were not able to ſubſiſt for want of proviſions and fodder; the Horſe firſt were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to break through, the Foot then were drawn into a place of advantage, and there ſtood upon their defence, every Regiment keeping to his poſt: while this was doing, the General and the Lord <hi>Roberts,</hi> Lord Marſhal of the Field, put themſelves into a Boat, and leave the Army, and the Major General of the Army,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:171593:26"/> with all the Officers of the Army to ſhift for themſelves, without ſo much as ever acquaintaing them therewith, or giving them the leaſt notice thereof; inſomuch that Major General <hi>Skippon,</hi> Major General of the Army, underſtanding by one of the Officers of the Lord Generals Regiment, that, that Regiment did not keep to their Poſt, as they ſhould, ſaid, <hi>that is ſtrange, that Regiment was not wont to do ſo, why do you not acquaint the General with it?</hi> The Officer replied, <hi>the General is gone, and the Lord Marſhall, away in a Boat: What,</hi> ſaid Major General <hi>Skippon, hath our General left us thus, and never ſo much as acquainted us therewith? Then indeed it is time for us to make conditions for our ſelves,</hi> and he and the Officers had it in conſultation, before they would treat about conditions, to put that down as the ground of their treating, <hi>their Generals deſerting the Army in that manner,</hi> wherein the Lord <hi>Roberts</hi> went along with him, who was the ſpecial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of drawing the Army into that condition: that he was the Authour of that counſel, in ſuch a faſhion to withdraw and leave the Army to ſhift for themſelves (when they were in a poſture to defend themſelves, and refuſed not to fight, but were, as it is known, more hardly drawn to yield to deliver up their Arms, than to uſe them to fight in the defence of themſelves) I will not ſay; but he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in the action, being, after the General, the Chief Commander in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: neither do I write it, as thinking the man to want courage, for in all other actions during the Wars before, he never ſhewed any want thereof; and that which he did preſently after this, in ſtaying in <hi>Plimouth,</hi> when it was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the King, upon the defeat of all our Forces, would attempt to take ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a place, manifeſted courage enough in him, as it was a great means to confirm and ſtrenghthen the Townſ-men, to defend the ſame; but I write it, to obſerve a ſpecial providence of God making him by an action, which all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souldiers will judge worthy to be much more condemned in a Chief Officer (as being far from <hi>holding out to utmoſt extreamity,</hi> but rather a deſerting of a whole Army without their knowledge, without making any conditions for them, when they were under his charge) to condemne himſelf for that unjuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which he was the ſpecial actor in, if not the contriver and author of, whereby a Gentleman was condemned, who by the judgement of the beſt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier amongſt them, yea, in the Army, or in the Kingdom, Sr. <hi>William Balfore,</hi> was rather thought worthy of commendation and reward, for what he had done, in holding out to that which is to be accounted <hi>utmoſt extreamity,</hi> as I have ſhewed before: yea, the very Enemies themſelves being Judges, as they have often, and divers of them expreſſed themſelves in his caſe, both the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hawly,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Busbridge</hi> with others. <hi>Thus doth the juſt God often make them, who dig pits for other men, fall into the pit themſelves.</hi> If any man ſhall doubt of the truth of this Relation, or any circumſtance in it, he may ſatisfie himſelf by aſking Major General <hi>Skippon,</hi> an antient experienced able Commander, and withall (which is not uſual) a pious religious man; or he may ſatisfie himſelf if he will aſk any of the Sub-Committee appointed at <hi>Darby</hi> houſe, to examin Major General <hi>Skippon,</hi> Colonel <hi>Barkley,</hi> and other Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this buſineſs, Mr. <hi>Pierpoint</hi> and Mr. <hi>St. Johns</hi> the Solicitor (as I take it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two of them; any of theſe know, that when Major General <hi>Skippon</hi> was aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether he ſpake thoſe words above ſpecified, upon hearing the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Lord Marſhals being gone in a Boat, he ſaid he did; and that it was very ſtrange to him and the reſt of the Officers to hear that they were gone, it being
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:171593:27"/> demanded of him further, whether they had it not in conſultation, to make his leaving of them in ſuch a manner, the reaſon of their entertaining, or ſeeking a Treatie about Conditions; he (as he is a very modeſt man) moſt humbly deſired them not to preſs him in that particular any further: ſo the Sub-Committee ſaw, that as it was left and laid aſide by the Officers, out of reſpect at that time when they had it in conſultation, in like manner they deſired they might not be preſſed further to ſpeak to it then, when they were examined; and there being ſome friends of the Generals, who were of the Sub-Committee, that moved it might be put on no further, it was paſſed over both by the Sub-Committee, the Committee, and the Houſe; to which friends of his he hath ſince made an ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital, becauſe they were for the new Moulding of the Armie, as they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and although, out of reſpect to the General, this was for the preſent paſſed over, and no further preſſed, yet this with other things, then laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in mens hearts of that reſolution, which ſoon after was put in execution, to new Model the Army, and put the Command into other hands: The Parliament dealt prudently for the preſent, after the example of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, upon the great defeat and loſs of their Armie at the Battle of <hi>Cannae;</hi> for they gave no discouragement, but rather ſent to the General being ſick at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to ſhew him a reſpect, that thereby they might the better recruit again that broken Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie which he had left, and make the beſt uſe of them that remained, againſt the Kings coming up and following his advantage, which they had cauſe to expect, and accordingly found to fall out; for he was taught by his experience, in ſitting down before <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> what advantage he had then loſt, and therefore now, would not beſiege <hi>Plimouth,</hi> but onely Face it, and ſo without ſtaying, marched forwards with all ſpeed: it was therefore neceſſarie for the Houſes of Parliament, to make up that broken Army both Horſe and foot with what ſpeed they could, and ſo make the beſt of a broken buſineſs; to which end they wiſely, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſent an incouraging viſit and meſſage to the General at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> all being little enough: for if my Lord <hi>Mancheſters</hi> Armie under <hi>Cromwel</hi> had not been ſo near <hi>London,</hi> that they were brought to joyn with the remainder of this broken Armie, ſo many of them as in ſo ſhort a time could be recruited; and alſo with what remained of Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> Armie, broken likewiſe by lying ſtill, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Abington,</hi> out of a meer pet, becauſe the General would not let him go into the Weſt, which was his deſign, but went thither himſelf; and had not this been done by that time, the King could advance ſo far as <hi>Newbury,</hi> that he had been able to march up to <hi>London</hi> without reſiſtance; upon this defeat of our Army in the Weſt, in all probabilitie all had been loſt; which had it ſo fallen out, the true Cauſe, under God, had been the private ſpleens, fooliſh pets, emulations and envie between our Commanders; The onely cauſe why Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> would follow the King no longer, when he turned Weſtward, and thereby the Generals Armie loſt, and his own alſo with lying ſtill and doing nothing the while: This was a juſt cauſe of putting our forces into a new Model, under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head, and into one hand, as would ſufficiently appear, were this miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age onely laid open particularly, &amp; in all the paſſages &amp; circumſtances thereof; but to write that ſtorie is not my deſigne, here I onely touch it thus far by the way; I have made this Digreſſion, and inſiſted the longer upon it, to make the truth appear, for the clearing of this Gentleman from that dishonor, which was ſo unjuſtly, and ſo unworthily caſt upon him, by ſuch a Major part of a Council
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:171593:27"/> of War, becauſe not onely ſcurrilous Pamphlets, as this and ſome others of like nature (whoſe railing and lying, ſhewing them apparently to be byaſed by their malice, envie, and other baſe falſe ends, every man will deſpiſe) but Mr. <hi>May,</hi> one that pretends to write a Juſt and Full Hiſtorie of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and in his Preface maketh profeſſion of ſo much impartialitie, he likewiſe is drawn (whether by falſe reports and ill information, or being jogged on the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow by him that ſet him on work, or ſome of his partie, he himſelf beſt knoweth) to let his pen drop a blot upon the reputation of this Gentleman, and it ſeemeth <hi>Briſtol</hi> is purpoſely brought in, and made mention of in that place, that he might give this daſh with his pen in a parentheſis: I will not ſay, that the partie, by whom he was put upon writing this Hiſtorie, or any of his, plucked him by the ſleeve, while he was writing, and cauſed him to give this blur needleſly, as any man that reads it may eaſily perceive, and therefore it may be thought purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for I would not in this particular ſay and affirm poſitively, that which I do not certainly know; This I do know, that they were eſtranged, and ill affected at that time to the friends of this Gentleman, who had done them greateſt ſervice to his own prejudice, and that when they were in low eſteem amongſt the people in the Citie, their hatred unto him being onely in reſpect of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the new Modelling of the Armie, as I have ſaid before; and who it was that put Mr. <hi>May</hi> upon the writing of his Hiſtorie, I very well know by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſpeeches, but I will not make an abſolute judgement upon conjectures: If it were ill information, he might eaſily have had better, had he ſought it, and I ſhall now better inform him, and ſhew him the falſhood of both parts of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis, not by ſaying alone they are falſe, but by demonſtrating it to be ſo by undeniable proofs, that when he continueth his Hiſtorie, he may reform his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and not by tranſmitting it to poſteritie, ſuffer it, the further it runs, the more to increaſe that guilt which ever accompanieth wrong doing: he brings in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Surrender of <hi>Briſtol</hi> to the Kings Forces without any occaſion; and then draws in his Parentheſis thus (<hi>which was more ſudden than could be feared, and for which afterward the Governor Mr.</hi> Fiennes <hi>was queſtioned &amp; condemned by a Council of War</hi>) for the firſt part, <hi>that it was more ſudden than could be feared,</hi> whereby he would make the world believe, he was too haſtie in Surrendering the place which he might and ought to have kept longer; what hath been ſaid to this alreadie I ſhall not need to repeat; but to the falſhood of it I ſhall ſay, that as the Enemie ſufficiently felt it before it was ſurrendered, by ſuch a loſs, as I my ſelf heard one of them who was there, a Colonel, ſince profeſs, <hi>that when they had it Surrendered, they thought and ſaid amongſt themſelves, they had better been without it, than to have undergone that loſs to obtain it;</hi> and as I remember another of them, Col. <hi>Busbridge,</hi> who affirmed in the hearing of divers Parliament men, Col. <hi>James Temple</hi> being one, <hi>he would maintain it with his ſword, againſt any that ſhould ſay the contrarie, it was as well defended, and they had as ſharp a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Storming of it as he had known, either here in</hi> England, <hi>or in the</hi> Low-Countreys, where he had been a Souldier; he ſaid, <hi>that after the Works were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Suburbs poſſeſſeſſed by them, there was ſuch a Sally made out upon them, that he ſaw</hi> 20 <hi>Officers brought into ſome houſes, and laid there upon the floors, or tables:</hi> The Enemie did not find ſuch over much haſte made in the Surrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Place, as Mr. <hi>May,</hi> by what he writes, would have men conceive: and that it was <hi>before we feared it or heard of it,</hi> is ſo falſe, that Mr. <hi>John Aſh</hi> depoſed

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:171593:28"/> the Town was in, deſired to convey that ſupply of Forces unto it. For the later part of his Parentheſis, <hi>that he was queſtioned for it, and condemned by a Council of War;</hi> I have ſhewed before, that this is the uſual falſhood, whereby ſtrangers to the carriage of this buſines, and eſpecially poſteritie, are like to be abuſed; it is moſt falſe, that he was <hi>questioned</hi> for this, either by the Parliament or by the General, as thinking him to have committed any fault in what he had done, or teſting any way unſatisfied with him for it, and thereupon calling him in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at a Council of War; he was not <hi>queſtioned,</hi> but, as hath been ſaid, with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie obtained, that the ſlanders, ſpread abroad by baſe Libellers againſt him, might be <hi>queſtioned,</hi> and he cleared from them: that onely is true in it, that he was condemned by that Council of War, and no mervail, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved before hand, as you have heard; and the whole carriage of it hath been truly related, whereof there is not bare affirmations onely, but ſufficient proofs. Mr. <hi>May,</hi> had his affections lean that way, might much more juſtly and truly have brought in a parentheſis, to commend this Gentlemans fidelity, wiſdom, vigilancy, and courage ſhewed in ſaving that Town (when Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was without with 4000 Horſe and 2000 Foot, as himſelf ſaith, and a conſpiracy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to betray it unto him, of ſo many, and thoſe ſo powerfull in the Citie, as one of them was Sherieff that year, or the year before, and the Town at that time little better fortified than any open Village in the Countrey) than here to draw in a parentheſis, purpoſely to diſgrace him; and yet of this, though he handle it in particular, he thinks not fit to ſpeak one word in his commendation. It is well enough known, that if the General had not ſent Collonel <hi>Fiennes</hi> down, having notice of this deſign of Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> upon the Town, by Mr. <hi>White,</hi> and commanded him to take care of it, the Town had then been loſt; and for his own particular, as he hath been ſince rewarded for his ſervice, it had been better he had let it alone and gone into <hi>Gloceſter-ſhire,</hi> whither at the requeſt of Mr. <hi>Stephens,</hi> and other Gentlemen of that Countrey, the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> being Lord Lieutenant thereof, he was ſent by the General, with ſome other Troops of Horſe with him under his Command; but at the inſtance of Mr. <hi>White,</hi> and upon his information of the danger <hi>Bristol</hi> was in, by reaſon of this deſign upon it, whereof the General had ſome notice before another way, and finding it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Mr. <hi>Whites</hi> coming up purpoſely to inform him thereof; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to take that in his way, and do his beſt to prevent that danger, if he ſhould perceive any ſuch thing as was feared and reported to be in deſign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Town; and onely by his care and induſtry it was prevented, as all men know, and he afterwards thus rewarded: Mr. <hi>May,</hi> in all this, takes notice of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Prince</hi> Ruperts <hi>happineſs, that he took it afterwards, with more Honour and leſs bloud-ſhed,</hi> ſo all the commendation is given to Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> good fortune; but mark this falſhood with the reſt, for it coſt Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſo much bloud before he took it, what ever Mr. <hi>May</hi> is pleaſed to report in his ſtorie of it, that the purchaſe by themſelves was not thought worth the price they were made to pay for it: I have added this, that Mr. <hi>May</hi> himſelf, whom I have heard to be an ingenuous man, may judge, whether in all theſe things he hath uſed that indifferency which is, ſuitable to his promiſes, conſidering with what Elogies he followeth other men, reſerving diſcourſes, as he ſaith, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be handled for that end, apart by themſelves; who indeed were the men that left that Town, and by their own confeſſion, under their hands, <hi>if they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:171593:29"/> ſhould be beaten and loſe the Field,</hi> when they preſſed him that was Governour, to aſſiſt them with 1200 of the beſt Souldiers of his Garriſon, ſent under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Lieutenant Colonel, <hi>as the onely way and means to ſave the Town,</hi> as it was reſolved, not by themſelves alone, but at a Council of War, as I have ſhewed, before he would yield to part with any of his Guarriſon to ſtrengthen them in the Field, for he made that Objection, <hi>that they might be beaten, and loſe the Field,</hi> as they did, <hi>and the ſtrength of his Garriſon thereby;</hi> and how did they loſe it? Mr. <hi>May</hi> will not tell us, when they had betwixt 2 or 3000 Horſe, and 2000 ſtout and good Foot, as they ſhewed themſelves to be, and this againſt 1100 Horſe onely, without Foot, or Artillery, they being furniſhed with both, for there came no more under <hi>Wilmot</hi> from <hi>Oxford;</hi> theſe things are well known, and might eaſily have been known to Mr. <hi>May,</hi> had he been willing to know them; but becauſe he hath no will to take notice of them (for they ſute not well to his <hi>panegyrick reſerved diſcourſes</hi>) give me leave a little to diſcover the truth of thoſe Weſtern buſineſſes, which ended in this unhappy defeat at the <hi>Devizes,</hi> and how that Army was there loſt. Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> being ſent unto the Weſt, the place he deſired to be imployed in, offering to command in chief, and not to be kept under the General in his Army, as all men know, and the ſad event, lately mentioned, of the loſs of the Generals Army in the Weſt, made it too manifeſt; he being with his Forces at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> as Mr. <hi>May</hi> tels us, the King ſent Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> with forces from <hi>Oxford</hi> into the Weſt, to joyn with Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> and his Weſtern Forces drawn out of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> that by that conjunction there might be an Army ſtrong enough to ſubdue all the Weſt, and overthrow thoſe Countrey Forces, which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Free-holders of thoſe parts, well affected to the Parliament and their own juſt Rights, had raiſed for the maintenance thereof; amongſt whom, the principal were Sir <hi>Francis Popham</hi> and his ſons, with Sir <hi>John Horner</hi> and others, this Mr. <hi>May</hi> toucheth, but tels not, how all their Forces, which were conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, were ſuffered to be loſt, though ſo well affected to the Parliament as none more; he tels indeed what Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> was a doing, while he ſuffered them to be loſt and ſcattered by the Enemie, which he might have prevented, and ought, by the Charge committed to him of thoſe Countreys, and ſo have joyned to his own forces ſo conſiderable a ſtrength of the well affected people of thoſe Countreys, raiſed and armed by the Gentlemen for the Parliament: For had he, when he went out of <hi>Bristol,</hi> as all men expected, and in all reaſon was fit to be done, gone to aſſiſt thoſe Gentlemen, who had raiſed the Forces of the Countreys, to oppoſe <hi>Hoptons</hi> advance forwards, and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> and <hi>Marquis Hartfords</hi> joyning their Forces with him, they had overthrown them, &amp; broken them ſeverally, before ever they could have meet and joyned their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together, and all thoſe Countreys Forces, raiſed by thoſe worthy Gentlemen in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Countreys, had been encouraged, aſſiſted, and preſerved, (who had ſhewed ſuch conſtant affection to the Parliament) to be joyned to the Forces Commanded by Sr. <hi>William Waller,</hi> which would have made that Army ſo ſtrong, as all the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>England</hi> muſt needs in all probability have ſubmitted to the Parliament, there being no Forces left that could oppoſe ſuch a ſtrength as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Sr. <hi>William Waller</hi> would have had: but in ſtead of going about ſo neceſſary a ſervice, as this then was, what doth he? Contrary to mens expectations, upon ſome intelligence coming to him, that <hi>Hereford,</hi> or this, and that other Town in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:171593:29"/> thoſe parts might be ſurpriſed, out of <hi>Briſtol</hi> he goes, and flies (as Mr. <hi>May</hi> terms it) clean another way from giving aſſiſtance to the Gentlemen, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him, and preventing the conjunction of the Kings Forces, which could admit of no delay; and ſtayes in taking and plundering <hi>Hereford</hi> and ſome other Towns, untill Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> and Marquis <hi>Hartford,</hi> in the mean time, without any oppoſition, or interruption, unite all their Forces together, fall upon thoſe Gentlemen and their Forces, who waited for his coming and aſſiſtance, break them and ſcatter them, to the great diſſervice and prejudice of the Parliament at preſent, but eſpecially as it proved afterwards: that which he in the mean time was running up and down after, far from the place that then required his preſence, and that which Mr. <hi>May</hi> reſerves his diſcourſe to ſet forth, was a ſervice which afforded himſelf plunder, and that, as Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſaith, <hi>much to his advantage,</hi> but neither profit nor advantage to the Parliament at all, for the Towns being plundered, were left, and afterwards poſſeſſed by the Enemie again, fortified and kept againſt the Parliament, as is known by the Siege of <hi>Hereford,</hi> where the whole Army of the <hi>Scots</hi> lay after this a long time, and could not reduce it: When this plundering voyage was paſt, which Mr. <hi>May</hi> ſets forth at large, but putting things together, which, I take it, differed in time (it may be, as they were brought unto him) Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> returns, when it was too late, towards <hi>Briſtol,</hi> finds <hi>Hopton</hi> with his Weſtern Army joyned with the Forces brought by Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> and Marques <hi>Hartford,</hi> and by them the Countrey Gentlemen and their forces diſperſed, the Enemies Army grown ſo ſtrong by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and thoſe that came in unto them, upon the ſcattering of the Forces of the Gentlemen, that in the Countreys were well affected, for want of timely aſſiſtance, that he with all his forces was not able to encounter them, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to preſs the Governor of <hi>Briſtol</hi> to afford him both men and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, otherwiſe he could not keep the field, and then both Town and Countrey would be loſt: This was the effect of that his rambling and running up and down from the ſervice, that required his preſence and his Forces, by which, all this disſervice and prejudice that the Parliament received, might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; but this plundering journey diverted him, that he neither gave timely aſſiſtance to their friends, nor oppoſition to the Enemie. The Governor of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,</hi> as hath been ſaid, afforded him both Ammunition and 1200 Souldiers, the ſtrength of that Garriſon, upon the reſolution at a Council of War of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers (ſome of the chief Gentlemen of the Countreys retired in thither, and Townſmen being preſent) <hi>that as things then stood, the onely means to ſave that Town was, to ſtrengthen him, that he might not loſe the Field:</hi> upon this addition of ſtrength, with Ammunition, ſent him out of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> they fight the Enemie, the Fight continued till night without any conſiderable advantage appearing on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide; that which ſeemed to give the advantage to Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> was Sir <hi>Ralph Hoptons</hi> drawing off the Field, and Marching away the next morning, which it was thought was occaſioned by want of Ammunition, ſome accident in the Battle befalling him in that reſpect; and this is made the more probable, by the Ammunition ſent unto him from <hi>Oxford</hi> to the <hi>Devizes,</hi> which was intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whatever was the cauſe, he left the Field and marched away; Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> with his Army following, he retreated into the <hi>Devizes,</hi> and Prince <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> and Marques <hi>Hartford</hi> went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> with all his Forces, Horſe and Foot, blocks them up in this Town, intercepts Ammunition ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:171593:34"/> It is well known that <hi>Banbury</hi> was never any Garriſon of the Parliaments, no more than any other open Village in the Countrey, for ſuch was that Town; neither was the Caſtle in it any other; than an old houſe of the Lord <hi>Sayes,</hi> wherein he never inhabited; the King indeed afterwards made it a ſtrong piece, as moſt in <hi>England,</hi> and put a Garriſon into it, to the ſpoiling of that Town, and drawing all the adjacent parts of the Countreys about it under contribution; and for this the Town may thank themſelves, and the parts adjacent had little cauſe to thank them; for the Parliament had twice ſent Forces (before the King meddled with it) to fortifie it, once from <hi>Coventrie</hi> 300 Souldiers, and a ſecond time 200 from <hi>Northampton,</hi> both times the Town deſired they might not be put into the Caſtle, fearing it might bring the Kings Forces upon them; and thereby what they feared, and might thus have prevented, ſoon after befell them, the King ſending Forces into that Caſtle, and by <hi>Green</hi> the Enginier ſtrongly fortifying it. By whom then was <hi>Banburie</hi> ſurrendred to the prejudice of the Parliament? was it by the Kings Forces, for never any other had a Garriſon in it? Here you ſee one of his fine fables: but that he may have no creeping hole, like a Fox, to get out at, I will not leave unanſwered, that which I can imagine could give any colour to this tale told him, or invented by him: At the firſt beginning of theſe unhappy troubles, before any ſtroke ſtruck, or War begun, when the ſettling of the Militia by Ordinance of Parliament and Authority thereof, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Array</hi> by Warrant from the King, were in agitation in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Kingdom, there were ſeveral meetings, in the ſeveral parts of thoſe Counties, upon the putting in execution the one and the other of theſe Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but as yet without blows, or bloud-ſhed: it fell out to be ſo in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Northampton,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of that County by Commiſſion from the King, indeavouring to execute the Commiſſion of <hi>Array,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> on the other ſide to put in execution the ordinance of Parliament for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of the <hi>Militia;</hi> ſo when the one ſent out Warrants to call together the Train-band-men, and Voluntiers, to one ſide of the Countie, the other ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned them to another: during this contention between them in the Countie, the Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> without Warrant, either from the General, or the Parliament, (as is to be gathered from his own words) conveys down 4 Peeces of Ordnance from <hi>London,</hi> to carrie them to his Caſtle at <hi>Warwick;</hi> when he had brought them to <hi>Banbury,</hi> the Gentlemen of <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> who met the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> there, doubted they ſhould not be ſtrong enough to go through with that buſineſs, and carrie the Ordnance to <hi>Warwick,</hi> if the Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi> ſhould meet them upon the way, as they ſuſpected he would, having had notice of it; hereupon the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> ſent unto Mr. <hi>John Fiennes,</hi> and deſired him to accompanie them with ſo many as he could get to go along with him, which he did, and had ſo many that voluntarily came unto them, out of <hi>Banbury</hi> and other Towns adjoyning, that when the Lord of <hi>Northamton</hi> met them, as he did upon the edge of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire,</hi> after a little time that they had ſtood facing one another, there were twice as many with the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> as there were with him, in ſo much, that it was reported the Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi> ſhould ſay to thoſe Gentlemen, who had put him upon this buſineſs, that <hi>they had brought him there to loſe his Honor;</hi> for it was thought if one of the Pieces of Artillerie, whereof they had four, beſides a double number of men, had been discharged upon them, they having none, they had all left the Field preſently, and, if I mistake not, ſome of themſelves have
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:171593:34"/> confeſſed as much: But the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Purefoy,</hi> who were the chief actors in that buſineſs, thought it fitter at that time to treat, than fight, and to that end ſent to my Lord <hi>Northampton</hi> to treat with him, who ſtood ſtifly upon this, that no Pieces of Artillery ſhould be brought into <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi> to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any place in that County, without the Kings Commiſſion for it, and therefore they muſt carry the Ordnance back again out of the County; which in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, notwithſtanding the great advantage they had, they agreed unto, a thing wondered at, and the Pieces were drawn back out of <hi>Warwick-ſhire</hi> to <hi>Banburie,</hi> being aſked by friends, why they would do this, having a double number of men and Artillery beſides, the conditions alſo being diſhonorable? they both gave this for the reaſon (which I know to be true, for I heard it) that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not be the firſt that ſhould begin this unhappy War and ſtrike the firſt blow in it, and ſhed the firſt bloud: it ſeems alſo they had no Warrant for what they had done, in bringing of the Pieces down: for the Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> when they came back again to <hi>Banburie,</hi> deſired Mr. <hi>John Fiennes,</hi> that he might leave the Pieces in the Caſtle of <hi>Banburie,</hi> untill he went to <hi>London</hi> and got a Warrant from the Parliament to carry them to his Caſtle at <hi>Warwick;</hi> whereby it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he had none before, but had done it of his own head without Authority; he promiſed alſo Mr. <hi>Fiennes</hi> to return again within a week, but he neither came himſelf, nor brought, nor ſent any Warrant from the Parliament, or the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, within a week, a fortnight, or three weeks, as I take it; in which time the King being ſent unto by the Lord of <hi>Northampton,</hi> ſent a Warrant to him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Ordnance in his name, and commanded the Earles of <hi>Darbie</hi> and <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> with the Chief Gentlemen in Office in <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> to require the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of them upon his Warrant; theſe came to <hi>Banburie</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> and Sr. <hi>Nicholas Biron,</hi> who was ſent by the King with the Warrant to require the Ordnance in the Kings name, and they altogether with the Townſmen deſired Mr. <hi>Fiennes,</hi> that he would not, by diſobeding the Kings War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, be the firſt that ſhould begin a War, and make his own Countrey and theirs, and that Town, the feat of it, and that for the Ordnance of a private man which he had no Warrant to keep; there being the Kings Warrant require<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the delivery of them, and challenging them to be his: at that time all War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants from the King, which were not by Parliament adjudged illegal (as that of the Commiſſion of <hi>Array</hi>) were obeyed as formerly, all Writs iſſued in his name, and under his Seal: Mr. <hi>Fiennes</hi> upon this Warrant delivered the Ordinance, having no Authority to keep them from the Parliament, or General, which might protect him againſt that Authority which required the delivery of them, neither was there any Authority for bringing them thither that he knew of, but he might rather ſuſpect it was not approved of, when he could hear nothing of the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> (who promiſed to bring a Warrant from the Parliament within a week) in two, or three weeks, and yet he knew he went up purpoſely for it, as himſelf ſaid: what wiſe man can think it fit, for him, without any Warrant, to juſtifie ſuch an action, to be the beginner of ſuch a quarrel as this, for another man, who upon that very reaſon, and becauſe he had no Warrant for what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o him from the King, as there was to Mr. <hi>Fiennes?</hi> if Mr. <hi>Fiennes</hi> had been the firſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:171593:35"/> man that had ſhed bloud, and begun this War to keep theſe Ordnance without any Warrant for it, nay, ſeeing a Warrant was not ſent when purpoſely gone for, but ſo long delaid, and he might thereupon well think denied; what could have excuſed him from being a Murtherer, a Traitor, the firſt kindler of this unhappy fire in the Kingdom, and running moſt fooliſhly into all theſe crimes, by doing that without all Obligation thereunto for another, who for fear of this, durſt not, or would not do it for himſelf? The Law would have condemned him juſtly, and he had no ground to expect protection from the Parliament, having no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor Warrant from them for ſuch an action. Thus you have that which I think to be the ground and onely colour for this Tale, which he dreſſes up, in this Pamphlet, into a falſe ſlander, purpoſely to diſgrace that Family, which it is well known hath not deſerved ill of this Kingdom, nor of his own Nation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever requited: If there be any other thing imaginable concerning <hi>Banburie</hi> that hath come to his ears, which are wide open to receive what ever may give him the leaſt pretence, or colour to caſt up his gorge againſt this Family, it can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what befell <hi>Banburie</hi> after the Battle at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> ſome five miles from that Town, which, in reſpect of that Family, is as idle and ridiculous as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, not one of them being there, or near the place when the battle was fought: two of them were in the Generals Army when the fight was, and did as good ſervice there, as thoſe who are taken notice of by name, being of the ſame place and rank in the Army that they were, as Sr. <hi>William Balfore</hi> and Sr. <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> in whoſe Regiments they were, could witneſs: But upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it not having been obſerved by others, I will lay open the miſcarriage of that buſineſs in particular, with the conſequences thereof, which will appear to be one of the moſt unſouldier-like, unreaſonable, and unhappy, that hath fallen out in all theſe Wars. The Generals Army being, in the beginning of the fight, in ſome danger, it pleaſed God yet in the end to turn the day and give him the victory, though a conſiderable part of his Army were not then come up to the reſt, which invited the Enemy the rather to engage in the fight: when all the Kings Foot were broken except two Regiments, and thoſe but pieces of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which remained, their Horſe coming up to them, they withdrew out of the Field where the battle had been fought, leaving the General and his Army upon the ground, and ſo retired up to the top of the Hill, where the Horſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometime, untill they could draw off their Ordnance, the Horſe alſo went away: At that time came in Colonel <hi>Hamden,</hi> with three freſh Regiments of Foot, and ten Troups of Horſe, and ſome Artillery, to the Generals Army, theſe coming up after the fight was ended, a freſh ſupply not having been at all in the battle, when it was expected, the Enemy being beaten out of the Field, and this addition of freſh Forces come to the Army, they would have advanced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, having but five miles to go to <hi>Banburie,</hi> and make uſe of this good ſucceſs to the compleating of the victory, which had they done, the King had not had one of his Foot remaining, all his Ordnance, Ammunition and baggage taken, and been forced himſelf to eſcape with his Horſe, which would have been diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for him then to have done, for he himſelf afterwards complains, that the Countreys thereabout were prepared and reſolved to riſe upon him: In ſtead of doing this, which in all probability had made an end of this unhappy War in the firſt beginning of it; The General with <hi>Merick</hi> and <hi>Ballard</hi> (it was thought by their adviſe) ſuddenly rides back ſeven miles, to <hi>Warwick,</hi> a place deſtitute of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:171593:35"/> proviſions to refreſh the Army (which was the pretence of it) by their having quartered about it as they came but a day, or two before, whereas had they marched to <hi>Banburie,</hi> they had had all plenty of proviſions, where the Countrey expected them, and for their own ſafety, deſired their coming; and this was done ſo ſuddenly and unexpectedly to all the reſt of the Officers, that Sr. <hi>William Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> Colonel <hi>Hamden,</hi> Sr. <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> with divers others, admired at it, and were much grieved for it, as they teſtified in their ſpeeches one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſome of them expreſſed then, what they aſſured themſelves would be the ſad effects thereof, which proved ſo, and quickly appeared; for the King fearing nothing more than the Generals advancing with his Army after him, was going away and paſſing by <hi>Banburie</hi> with what ſpeed he could; but when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the General was gone back to <hi>Warwick,</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with the Horſe went to the place where the battle was fought, and the Forces that were paſſing by <hi>Banburie,</hi> with the Artillery, were drawn back thither, the Town being as I have ſaid an open Village, having neither Walls, Gates nor Bars, at any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance into it, but having with Carts, Boards, and ſuch like other things ſtopped the paſſages into the Town as well as they could, to prevent the Enemies ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Horſe from plundering the Town, expecting the Generals Army for their defence, when they heard, after the fight and victory, he had left them and was turned back to <hi>Warwick,</hi> twelve or fourteen miles from them, and ſaw the Kings Forces thereupon returned to the Town, the Townſmen preſently pulled down thoſe Barricadoes, which they had ſtopped the enterance into the Town with, knowing the other Army having deſerted them, they could not hold it an hour againſt that force the King had left with him, nor the Caſtle againſt the Kings Ordnance, being then without any fortification, as hath been ſaid; and this they did, hoping to be better dealt withall, when they made no reſiſtance, which would have been to no purpoſe; hereupon that Town was taken and plundered, and the whole Countrey of <hi>Oxford-ſhire</hi> given up into the Enemies hands, which inſtantly before had manifeſted as good affection to the Parliament as any, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily appearing with their Train-bands, upon the ſettling of the Militia, for the Parliaments aſſiſtance, and that on every ſide of the County, and all that were obſerved thereby to have ſhewed themſelves well affected to the Parliament gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up, by this Counter-march backward, to be ſufficiently plundered by the Enemy: but this, though bad enough, was not all; for the King hereupon (as he had a very good colour given him) aſſumes the victory to himſelf, indeed all the advantages of a victory were given him hereby, poſſeſſeth himſelf of <hi>Oxford,</hi> makes that the place of his reſidence, being in the heart of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; alſo by ſurpriſing ſome Forces of the Generals Army, as the Lord <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boroughs</hi> Regiment that accidentally quartered in <hi>Banburie,</hi> as they were going to the Army, and ſome others, all which were given up into the Enemies hands, with other Forces taken up in that County, thus given up as the reſt to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and the Forces which came in unto him, upon the fame of his having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the victory and beaten back the Parliaments Army, for which he cauſed a ſolemn Thankſ-giving to be kept in <hi>Oxford;</hi> he recruits his broken Army, and is put into a capacity again and a fair probability to compaſs his firſt deſign, to march up to <hi>London,</hi> poſſeſs himſelf of that Citie, and ſo deſtroy the Parliament; how near he came unto the effecting of it, the buſineſs at <hi>Branford</hi> makes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all men, who are acquainted with theſe paſſages from firſt to laſt: Here
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:171593:36"/> is this Surrender of <hi>Banburie,</hi> if this be it he aims at, indeed it was likely to have proved the Surrender of Parliament, Citie, and whole Kingdom, and that by a victorie thus given to the Enemy, when obtained by us; for to redeem this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and prevent the miſchiefs likely to follow thereupon, the General was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to make ſuch long marches, that the King with his recruited Army might not be at <hi>London</hi> before him, that he brake and weakned his Army very much, and then bringing them into the Citie, loſt them as in a Wood, ſo that when the King came to <hi>Branford,</hi> within ſeven miles of <hi>London,</hi> with his whole Army, ſo few of the Generals could be gotten together, that ſome of the Members of both Houſes were neceſſitated to fit up all night with the Major and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Militia of <hi>London</hi> at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> to perſwade them to ſend forth the Regiments of the Train-bands of <hi>London,</hi> under Major <hi>Skippon</hi> to reſiſt the Kings Army; making it appear to them, how much ſafer it would be for the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to oppoſe the Enemies coming into it, than to fight with him in their ſtreets, where he would finde many friends to joyn with him: with no little difficulty, at one of the Clock after-midnight, they were perſwaded to ſend forth a very good ſtrength, which had they not done, all had been indangered, as one, or two of the Regiments of the Generals Army, the Lord <hi>Brooks</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> his were ſurpriſed and broken in <hi>Branford.</hi> Theſe were the foul failings, and great miſcarriages of our firſt beginnings in War, when we were but young Soldiers, and had little experience in military affairs in reſpect of actions of War, or Councils of War, ſo that it had been better for ſome, how able ſoever they were, or what good ſervice ſoever they had performed, that they had had nothing to do with either; the truth is, untill the new Modelling of the Army, no ſucceſs was followed to any great advantage of the Parliament, but if one action in a Summer were performed, then preſently Winter quarters were thought of, though in the midſt of Summer, and in the next Spring the Parliament was new to begin again, both in providing money and men, and ſo the Wheel turned about, the King having time enough given him thereby, upon any loſs fully to recover himſelf; but when the Army was Moulded anew (occaſioned in great part by the obſervation hereof, and ſome other things) then the buſineſs went on in another manner, with good ſucceſs, and that followed to good purpoſe, and all well carried along, ſo long as the War continued. This particular paſſage of <hi>Banburie,</hi> which hath occaſioned the opening of this whole buſineſs fully, was ſuch, that Mr. <hi>May</hi> in his Hiſtorie cannot paſs it by, but tells us that a Noble Gentleman of the Parliaments ſide, expreſſed himſelf much to the ſame purpoſe, that I have here related, for the ſubſtance of it; and it is likely it was ſome of thoſe Officers, Members of the Houſe of Parliament, of whom I ſpake before, that uſed theſe ſpeeches to him, for they all profeſſed againſt it. If any man ſhall think I have inſiſted too long upon theſe two particulars, let him know, that I have the rather done it, that men may ſee the great difference that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things when they are related nakedly, according to the truth of them, as they were acted, without any factious dreſſings or vizards put upon them; and when they are diſguiſed with falſhood, to ſerve ſome mens ends, and carrie on their deſigns: I ſhall therefore do the like in other particulars, as I meet with them, ſtrangers and poſteritie being the perſons moſt of all abuſed by theſe paintings and daubings, malicious ſcratchings, and daſhings, too much uſed by Hiſtorians: beſides, I have a good example and preſident to follow, in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:171593:36"/> the Honor of this Familie, from the lyes and ſlanders of malicious, or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Hiſtorians and Pamphleters, the ſame being formerly done by a <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorian, ſhewing the falſhood and ignorance, or malice of <hi>du-Serres,</hi> in ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing <hi>Robert de Fiennes,</hi> Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> and making his error therein apparent out of authorities, which if he had had either care or learning enough to have ſearched and conſidered, he had never tranſmitted ſuch a lye and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to poſteritie, concerning a Noble man of worth, who had done good ſervice to the King and Kingdom, acknowledged by the King himſelf: but theſe things we muſt expect from impudent and malitious Pamphleters, and ignorant Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who will be writing whether true or falſe.</p>

This I have here the rather inſiſted upon, that I may not be troubled to take notice of every Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he reads them, as ſoon after he doth, for <hi>the companie they admitted into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacie with them, for which,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>they were laughed at:</hi> for ſuffering ſuch a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or ſetting him on work to write ſuch a ridiculous ſtorie as this is, they might indeed be much more worthy to be laughed at, and ſure to gain neither credit nor advantage by ſuch tales.</p>
            <p>But to come to ſome particulars, he inſtanceth in; For that of <hi>our low eſtate things being almoſt,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>in deſpair,</hi> a fiction of his own brain, which he ſtill dreſſeth up like a poor indigent beggar, and brings upon the ſtage, when he would have it believed, that pure neceſſitie and fear, made us call for the help of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and make the world believe, what great aſſiſtance they gave us, which what it was the world well knoweth, and we to our coſt found; this I will here paſs, having given anſwer to it before, neither will I trouble my ſelf with ſhewing what <hi>thoſe wonders</hi> were, which he ſaith, <hi>they did,</hi> and <hi>ſtrange encounters theſe reſolute men</hi> (as he terms them) <hi>met withall at their firſt coming into the Kingdom, and made their way through them all;</hi> I have alreadie ſhewed, that if we had not been in a better condition than his ignorance or falſhood reports us to be in, able not onely to defend our ſelves without them, but to bring them through thoſe difficulties they met withall, they had ſtuck in the birth, and not been delivered from the Lord <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> Armie and the Countreys oppoſition. I will come to thoſe paſſages, wherein according to his cuſtome under the name

The <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners at their firſt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:171593:38"/> coming into <hi>England,</hi> finde theſe men, whom this fellow will make to be creſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen in their reputations (one of his particular falſhoods) to be in higheſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and power in the Houſes of Parliament, for their known fidelitie to the publick, and abilitie to do ſervice thereunto, ſo little need had they of ſuch props, as the <hi>Scots,</hi> to hold up their reputation; hereupon the <hi>Scots</hi> apply themſelves chiefly to them, and fall into intimacie with them, as conceiving that to be the beſt means for them to prevail in what they ſhould deſire in both Houſes: This correſpondencie they held with <hi>theſe leading men,</hi> or <hi>rulers of affairs</hi> (as he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times names them, complaining withall, that <hi>Sectaries prevailed too much with them</hi>) untill they found, they could by no means lead them from making The defence of the known juſt Rights, and Liberties of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and Priviledges of Parliament (the Supream Court therein) the cauſe of their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of Arms; and in ſtead thereof, change the ſtate of the quarrel, into a contention about the eſtablſhing of their Kirk Government here in <hi>England</hi> (as if the Parliament either had, or could juſtifie the taking up of Arms and fighting with the King, upon ſuch a ground) theſe worthy Patriots would never be drawn to this, to wave the juſt <hi>quarrel,</hi> the Parliament had ingaged the people and themſelves in; which was <hi>the defence of the Laws, and their own Liberties eſtabliſhed by them, with the Priviledges of the Supreameſt, and inferiour Courts of Juſtice, wherein thoſe Laws were to be made, and Juſtice adminiſtred according to them, and no Delinquent protected againſt them;</hi> all the compliance of the <hi>Scots Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi> and <hi>courting of them, till it was,</hi> as the School-maſter tells them, <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi> to others, would not prevail to bring them, in ſtead of this, to make the ſetting up of their <hi>Church-Government</hi> in this Kingdom, and the taking of a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> in ſuch a <hi>ſence</hi> as they would put upon it, the quarrel to be inſiſted upon, and this Kingdom kept in troubles for, without ſetling a ſafe peace, if all other things conducing thereunto ſhould be granted, except <hi>this Idol of theirs</hi> might alſo be advanced: <hi>that this was the true cauſe of the falling off of the</hi> Scots <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, from thoſe men,</hi> whom at firſt they had entertained with ſo much ſhew of friendſhip and intimacie, <hi>this Diſcourſer of theirs</hi> doth not deny, but calls it <hi>the firſt and main occaſion;</hi> onely to ſerve his turn, he turns it upon the other ſide from his Maſters, and then <hi>more ſuo</hi> declaims againſt Sectaries, and Schiſmaticks; as if all men were ſuch, who will not readily come and bow down before this Golden Image of his; then ignorantly, or willfully, ſtill interprets the Covenant ſo, as if thereby we were obliged ſo to do, and that the word of God were not the Rule. To clear this point a little more fully, let it be obſerved, who they were that the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners took by the hand and entered into privacy and intimacy with, after they fell off from theſe good Patriots, men known to be faithfull and conſtant in their integrity, to maintain the juſt Rights and Liberties of the Subjects, and to ſeek the publick good of the Kingdom, the true cauſe in which the Parliament was ingaged; and it will be found, that they were <hi>thoſe, who,</hi> both in the two Houſes of Parliament and in the Citie, <hi>carried on the Court deſigns,</hi> ſuch as had fallen off from a vigorous fierceneſs againſt the Court in the Parliaments firſt engaging, and afterwards manifeſted ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance therewith, and ſuch an alteration in their way, as was obſerved by all men; with theſe now they had their <hi>private meetings,</hi> it was known <hi>when</hi> they were at their Conſultations, and Cabals, and the houſes <hi>where</hi> they met; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at this Court-Ladies houſe, ſometimes at that Court-Ladies Chamber, for
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:171593:39"/> their meetings were often, and the active Ladies for the Court, the great Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronia's of the time, were admitted into Council, yea, ſought after, together with my Lord of <hi>Holland</hi> and others, who were of the ſame intelligence, and theſe were ſeldom abſent: theſe things being ſo known, that they cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied without impudent falſhood, let all unprejudiced men judge, who they were that for their own private ends and intereſts, changed Company, and what thoſe ends were likely to be, which this Company, laſt made choice of, would better ſute with and promote, than the former company that were quitted and left; by this alſo it may appear, at what an eaſie rate they would have been contented to paſs away into the Kings hands, and ſubjected to his uſurped Prerogative, our juſt Rights and Liberties, which we defended with the expence of ſo much Treaſure and bloud, and they by their League were bound to aſſiſt us for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of, could they thereby but have been aſſured to ſettle things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own wills, in their own Kingdom, &amp; their Kirk-Government in this, by complying with the Court, and caballing with all the Court partiſans in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Citie; the former Company were fit indeed to be left, when ſuch deſigns were to be ſet on Foot. But that which of all other things makes their intentions, in theſe particular carriages, and ſhifting of Companies, moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, was their deſire of a conference with the Houſes of Parliament, their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in that conference, and their ſubſequent actions in purſuance thereof, at that time when the four Bills were to be ſent to the King at the Iſle of <hi>Wight:</hi> The Houſes of Parliament, though they had then advantage enough, having all in their hands and under their power, yet that they might make it appear to all the World, that they ſought no other thing, but to enjoy their juſt Rights and Liberties by the Laws eſtabliſhed unto them, and that they might be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the enjoyment of them, and juſtified in ſtanding in the defence of them, reſolved to ſettle the Peace of the Kingdom, to bring the King to his Throne and Parliament again with Honour, to put an end to War and all the burthens and unhappy conſequences thereof, if theſe ſubſtantial and abſolutely-neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary things alone might be granted; for other things in difference, which were not eſſential to the enjoyment of our known Rights and Liberties and ſecurity therein, the Houſes reſolved, theſe being firſt granted, and the King thereupon come to his Parliament, they ſhould be conſidered of and tranſacted between the King and his two Houſes of Parliament in a Parliamentary way; upon this four Bills were drawn up, and paſſed both Houſes, in which thoſe things onely were contained, that might ſecure us for the future in our Liberties (conſidering what we had before undergone) and juſtifie our Lawfull, and neceſſary ſtanding for them, that all queſtions for the time to come concerning the ſame might hereby be taken away; theſe Bills paſſed and reduced into Acts, upon the Kings giving his aſſent to them by Commiſſion, he was preſently to come to <hi>London</hi> to his Parliament, an evidence to all poſterity, and to all the World, of the juſt and ſincere intentions of the two Houſes of Parliament according to their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Proteſtations from the beginning, and that no ſucceſſes, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages put into their hands, could al er them from the ſame: when this was thus concluded, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners interpoſe and deſire they may be heard, in a free conference between both Houſes &amp; themſelves, whereby firſt they ſpend a great deal of time, and thereby retard the ſending theſe Bills to the King; next they oppoſe what was deſired in the Bills, wherewith they had nothing to do,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:171593:39"/> nor no right to intermeddle with in this Kingdom, yet they did it with that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and in that manner pleaded for the Kings uſurped Prerogative againſt our juſt Rights and Liberties (whereof they had no cognizance, nor capacity to judge, and ill enough would they have taken it, if we ſhould have made our ſelves Judges of the Subjects Liberties and Rights in their Kingdom) that, as I have touched before, they were told by a Noble man at the Conference, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for the King at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> or the Kings Attorney himſelf would not have ſpoken more: all this will fully appear by the Anſwers, which the Houſe of Commons publiſhed to their printed Papers which they had ſpread about, which Anſwers, it may be, I ſhall annex to the end of this Diſcourſe, for the Readers fuller ſatisfaction, and that the four Bills contained nothing but what I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, will therein appear; and indeed to every knowing man, the reading of the Bills themſelves will evidence it, and the anſwers of the Houſes to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Papers will ſhew, that the onely ſtay of the Kings coming to a perſonal Treaty at <hi>London</hi> with his Parliament was, becauſe he would not firſt give this ſatifaction deſired. For the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners (after that <hi>Louden</hi> and <hi>Lanerick,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing newly come out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had ſpoken privately with the King) did vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently preſs, by their Letters and Papers, that the King might come to <hi>London</hi> to a Perſonal Treaty there, before any Propoſitions ſent unto him, or theſe Bills paſſed by him; though the ſame men before (whereby you may perceive who did ſhew themſelves ſhifters and changers) had in their Orations and Letters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it to be juſt, or ſafe, for the King to be admitted to <hi>London,</hi> or to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Treaty with the Parliament, untill he had firſt given ſatisfaction and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the people. The Houſes of Parliament would not therefore, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Orations at the Conference, and their Papers ſpread abroad about the Citie, conſent to the Kings coming to <hi>London</hi> to a perſonal Treaty, before any ſatisfaction, or ſecurity firſt given, in their anſwers to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Papers giving their reaſons for it; but drew up the four Bills, as I have ſaid, and ſent them to the King, that, paſſing them, he might come up and ſettle other things, being in perſon with his Parliament; and this will more manifeſtly appear by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and Votes paſſed upon the 17 of <hi>January,</hi> after the King had ſent his denial to paſs thoſe four Bills, whereby ſome ſecurity might have been given of his coming, with intention to agree with his Parliament, for the ſettling of the Rights and juſt Liberties of the Subjects; which Declaration I will here ſet down.</p>

            <p>But their ſubſequent actions, in purſuance of this Conference, were worſt of all; for when they had printed their long Orations, made againſt the Subjects juſt Rights, and to advance the Kings Prerogative, and ſpread them about the Citie, that their Court-party, with whom they had their Cabals frequently, might take notice of their activity this way, and the King himſelf alſo; not content with this, when they ſaw the Houſes would not be removed from their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſending theſe Bills, and making this offer unto the King, of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon terms ſo juſt and reaſonable (though, as I have ſaid, all then was in their hands, and the Kings own perſon) they go down into the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> unto the King, a little before the Houſes ſend their Commiſſioners with the Bills unto him; and he muſt needs be a very weak and ſimple man, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not gueſs at their buſineſs, and imagine what errant they went upon, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their proceedings before they went with the Houſes of Parliament, and the anſwer the King returned to the Houſes, which was a flat denial, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it was meet for him firſt to conſult with his Kingdom of <hi>Scotland:</hi> For is it imaginable, that the King, in the condition he was, would have refuſed to come to his Parliament and be ſet upon his Throne, and his Kingdom ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in peace, upon no other terms, than ſuch as might ſecure the Subjects, to enjoy the Laws and be governed by them and not by will? whereas afterwards he yielded and condeſcended to grant thoſe things, which were of a far higher nature, than what theſe Bills required; had he not been encouraged thereunto by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners, who went of purpoſe in the nick of time unto him, and could let him know by their intelligences (kept from time to time, and eſpecially obſerved at that time, with the principal leaders of the Court-party, in and about the Citie, as my Lord of <hi>Holland</hi> and others, and no doubt with thoſe in their own Kingdom, not being ignorant of proceedings there) what aſſiſtance he might expect from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and from the Citie and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys adjacent; all which ſoon after appeared, by the coming in of an Army out of <hi>Scotland</hi> under <hi>Hambleton,</hi> and by the riſings of the Countreys near <hi>London</hi> under <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Goring,</hi> expecting the party in the Citie would riſe and joyn with them; the breaking forth of all theſe not long after may give us juſt ground to ſuſpect, it was the hope of this given unto him, which made the King ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory at that time in refuſing the juſt and moderate deſires of his two Houſes of Parliament, and the Correſpondencies, Conſultations, and frequent Cabals, which paſſed between the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners and <hi>Holland,</hi> one of the chief heads of the Inſurrections, and with the reſt of that party, moſt obſerved (as I have ſaid) at that time, may well make us think what Agents they were in theſe buſineſſes, when they went down purpoſely to oppoſe the paſſing of thoſe four Bills by the King, as they had before, all they could, the ſending of them unto him. This act of theirs, as it was one of the worſt, ſo of the laſt, wherewith they took their leaves, and time it was to be gone after an action ſo unſeaſonable, ſo unhappy, for which this Kingdom, and their own, yea, it may be the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both will have juſt cauſe to wiſh (if no worſe) that they had never ſet foot on <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground; For had the King at that time paſſed thoſe four Bills, a Peace had been ſetled, ſafe and juſt to the Subjects, as Honorable to himſelf, and all troubles and confuſions ended, which, when they will now end, the Lord onely knoweth: theſe things being known to all men who underſtand the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that time, with the ſeveral paſſages thereof, <hi>let the World judge,</hi> as I have

            <p>He comes now to <hi>the Battle at Marſton-moor,</hi> for he keeps no method, either in reſpect of the order of things, or time wherein they were done, but takes them up as in his opinion they may beſt ſerve and be made uſe of, to aſperſe and calumniate thoſe that are not of his Faction or oppoſe the ſame; and ſo we muſt follow him to pull off his vizards, though therein we paſs to and again, from one end of the Pamphlet to the other.

The thing is ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe, and known to be ſo to all that were preſent and not run away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the turn of the day, that it is probable, he heard this tale of ſome of his Countrey-men, whoſe heels had carried them ſo far from the place, that they could ſee neither man nor action upon the ſame, nor tell how the ſcales came to be turned: his words are, <hi>that thoſe of the partie, he ſpake of a little before, to indear themſelves to the people</hi> (poor fellow, they needed no lyes like his to do that) <hi>attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to themſelves the Honor of the day, and did not ſtick to call one of theirs,</hi> THE

This was the Lords doing, to whom belong the iſſues of War, and it was indeed a mervailous mercy; and theſe were the inſtruments he was pleaſed chiefly to uſe therein, which he, that out of envie will not acknowledge, but rather, as this man doth, belye and disgrace, is not onely falſe and injurious towards man, but oppoſeth God by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking that choiſe which he thinks fit to make of Inſtruments, by whom he will pleaſe to work and give deliverance. Now, as for that which concerneth <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> himſelf, <hi>that he did not appear at all in the heat of the buſineſs, but for a little skar kept himſelf off, till the worst was paſt;</hi> what man is there, <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Scot,</hi> that hath either worth or honeſtie in him, who was preſent, that will not abhor ſuch an envious, malicious falſhood as this, fit to be fathered by none but the father of lyes himſelf? for it is known, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> charged in the Head of thoſe Regiments of Horſe in my Lord <hi>Mancheſters</hi> Army, which Horſe he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and with thoſe Regiments brake all the Regiments of the Enemies Army, firſt the Horſe, and after that the Foot, and that he continued with them, untill the victory was fully obtained (yea, and the Pſalm of praiſe for it ſung to God, to whom alone the Glory was due) commanding all the while they charged, and taking ſpecial care to ſee it obſerved, that the Regiments of Horſe, when they had broken a Regiment of the Enemies, ſhould not divide, and, in purſuit of the Enemie, break their order, but keep themſelves ſtill together in bodies, to charge the other Regiments of the Enemy, which ſtood firm, and were in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies both of Horſe and Foot; by this wiſe direction and order, which himſelf was preſent to ſee obſerved, his Regiments at laſt brake the Enemies Regiments, all, firſt the Horſe, then the Foot; and herein indeed was the good ſervice which <hi>David Leſley</hi> did that day, with his little light <hi>Scotch</hi> Nags (for ſuch they were then, and not ſuch as afterwards they made them out of Sr. <hi>John Fennicks</hi> breed, and our beſt Northern Horſe, for which they at their pleaſure would exchange
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:171593:42"/> their <hi>Scotch</hi> little Courſers when they came into thoſe parts) I ſay, in this he did very good ſervice, that when a Regiment of the Enemies was broken, he then fell in, and followed the chaſe, doing execution upon them, and keeping them from rallying again and getting into Bodies, whereby <hi>Cromwell</hi> with his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had the better means and opportunity, keeping firm together in Bodies, to fall upon the other Regiments which remained, untill they were, one after another, all broken and routed both Horſe and Foot: the Enemies Horſe, being many of them, if not the greateſt part, Gentlemen, ſtood very firm along time, coming to a cloſe fight with the Sword, and ſtanding like an Iron Wall, ſo that they were not eaſily broken; if the <hi>Scots</hi> light, but weak Nags had undertaken that work, they had never been able to ſtand a charge, or indure the ſhock of the Enemies Horſe, both Horſe and men being very good, and fighting deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately enough. I appeal to the conſciences of thoſe that were preſent, if this be not the true Relation of that Battle for ſubſtance; and in theſe particulars, how God was pleaſed to turn the Day, by what inſtruments principally, together with the manner of it; which being ſo, let all men judge, whether in this, as all along in other things throughout this Diſcourſe of his, this man under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion, and ſtanding for Reformation, the good Cauſe in hand, and ſuch like ſpecious terms and Titles, hath not this for his end and aim, To ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the name and reputation of ſome who deſerved it not, and caſt aſperſions upon others (though never ſo falſe and known to be ſo) who are men beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving? and where he hath occaſion to give due praiſe to one of his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as here to <hi>David Leſley,</hi> for doing good ſervice, yet he cannot do it, but that he muſt make advantage of it, to diſgrace and moſt falſely diſparage thoſe, whom <hi>David Leſley</hi> himſelf will confeſs, I believe, deſerved at that time beſt: and let men obſerve the end why this is conſtantly done by him, as they ſhall read over his Pamphlet (if they mean to trouble themſelves ſo much) and they will finde it to be, To weaken (if he could) the eſteem of <hi>that partie,</hi> as he calls them, which will not comply with his factious (and as he thinks fit they ſhould prove) tumultuous and ſeditious party; the ſeeds whereof, to promote his good Cauſe in hand, in theſe and other Papers ſpread abroad by him, he hath been very diligent in ſowing: this I touch here again, that by pointing the Reader to it once, or twice, I may leave it to himſelf, to obſerve hereafter in the Diſcourſe, as he ſhall finde it ſcattered up and down throughout the ſame, and ſtarted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every occaſion; wherewith though I would not trouble my ſelf any more, having ſufficiently in that point diſcovered his intentions and pulled off his goodly Vizards, yet his ſlanders and falſhoods are ſo groſs, that I ſhall hardly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my ſelf to paſs them by in ſilence.</p>
            <p>After this diſcourſe of the Battle at <hi>Marſton-moor,</hi> he comes to ſpeak of <hi>the ſiege and ſtorming of New-Caſtle,</hi> and this muſt not paſs plainly without welt and guard, but be ſet forth with Relations of the <hi>valour of his Countrey-men in taking the Town, and juſtice and fair carriage in the uſing of their ſucceſs and victorie;</hi> indeed he may ſet a mark upon this exploit, and lace it over, and bedaub it with his accuſtomed extolling and magnifying of all their actions; for as it was the firſt, ſo it was the laſt and onely Town that they ſtormed; as this Battle before ſpoken of, was the firſt and the laſt and onely ingagement of their whole Army, which it is known they never did, nor would ingage againſt an Army of the Enemies, without the conjunction of ſuch a Force of ours with them, as was
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:171593:42"/> ſufficient to do the work without them, as in effect was done here in this Battle. Two things concurring in the taking of this Town of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> the profit it yielded in reſpect of the Coals, and the conveniencie thereof for their ends, put them upon doing more than was their uſual cuſtom, or as it ſeemed their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon any other occaſion, while they were here in this Kingdom to aſſiſt us, as appeared when they were before <hi>Hereford,</hi> and as will appear afterwards in other things when we come to ſpeak of them: but let us hear his brags, they are ſo Romance-like, that they do his Countrey-men no advantage, but rather make men think all the reſt are lies too, and of the ſame ſtuff with theſe: Firſt he tells us of eight <hi>men of theirs, that of themſelves alone routed two Troups of Horſe;</hi> if he would have been a little bolder, and ſaid they had routed an Army of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then we ſhould have thought the Knight of the Sun and his Brother <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleer</hi> with their Companions had been alive again: after this he will needs have <hi>the very ſame men, who ran away at</hi> Marſton-more, to be the men who <hi>gave the aſſault, ſtormed the Town, and take</hi> New-Caſtle, that he may ſhew his care and ſkill in binding up the broken credit of his Countrey-men; indeed if they all ran away at <hi>Marſton-more,</hi> it muſt needs be the ſame men. For <hi>their fair car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in wronging no Man, Woman, or Childe,</hi> when they had taken the Town and made themſelves Maſters of it, which he much inlargeth, I will leave it to the relation of the men of thoſe Northern parts, what their carriage and demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor was, both there and elſewhere amongſt them, much whereof may be ſeen in that, which came up to the Parliament in Petitions and complaints from thoſe parts, remaining with the Clark amongſt the Papers in the Houſe of Commons, which this man it ſeems was not ignorant of, and therefore he provides a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and univerſal remedy for this diſeaſe, which grew very common in thoſe parts, and amongſt thoſe Northern people, Epidemical, after ſome time that the Army had been amongſt them; his remedy is, to tell you, that <hi>theſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern people are all Malignants, ſuperſtitious and prelatical, not onely the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the chief of the Countries, yea, the Committee men whom the Parliament had intruſted,</hi> therefore though complaints be ſent up to the Parliament from the people, that they are wronged in their perſons, in their wives, in their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in their goods, and that moſt ſhamefully, you muſt believe no ſuch thing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be confirmed by the Teſtimony of the beſt Gentlemen in thoſe Counties, or recommended to the Parliament, in the behalf of the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by the men whom the Parliament have intruſted to take care of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, for they are all Malignants, and he is much troubled, that any of them ſhould find any favourers: here you have a Catholicon, a Salve that cures any of thoſe ſores, if you will take it; let one of his Countrey-men plunder, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any villany, the moſt ſhamefull, as that at <hi>Tickhill</hi> about <hi>Nottingham,</hi> which, when Mr. <hi>William Pierepoint</hi> with ſome others were ſent thither by the Parliament, was complained off, and the Officers of the Army by theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen made acquainted with the complaint, the thing being very baſe, yet you muſt not believe Malignants in any thing againſt the <hi>honeſt Scots,</hi> who <hi>ſtill keep themſelves to their point,</hi> which point, if it were plundering, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he brags of their fair carriage, thoſe Northern Countreys will out of their own experience tell you it is too true.</p>

Here, when they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Southward, we ſhall hear of <hi>want of proviſions and draughts</hi> again; but where is that? not upon the Borders of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where they know this fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Fable, of a flying Army to go into <hi>Scotland,</hi> is nothing; that ſtayes them not, but they aſk it of <hi>the Committees of</hi> Cumberland <hi>and</hi> Weſtmerland, whom <hi>they finde very ſlow and unwilling to provide them thereof,</hi> he ſaith; what make they in <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmerland?</hi> the man toucheth it very tenderly, and quickly paſſeth from it; <hi>Carlile</hi> was the buſineſs; and to help the matter, he would make the World believe, <hi>the Committies were ſuch malignants and ſo falſe, that if the</hi> Scots <hi>had left</hi> Carlile <hi>then, whereunto they were near</hi> (but why came they ſo near, I pray?) <hi>the Enemy had kept it ſtill:</hi> give me leave to deal with him, in this particular, in his own way, and to uſe his own phraſes; Thoſe who look (as he uſeth to ſay) a little more deeply into the myſteries of things, find <hi>two cauſes</hi> of their not coming Southward to <hi>Darby,</hi> as they were ordered, at that time, though of ſo great concernment, that in likelyhood it had put an end to all the buſineſs; and of their willingneſs, rather to take an occaſion, but eſpecially ſuch a one as this of <hi>Carlile,</hi> to make ſuch haſte Northward: for the <hi>firſt,</hi> (what ever this Advocate for the <hi>Scots,</hi> his Countrey-men ſo often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of their fidelity in counſel, and activity in the field, Elogies moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly heaped upon them, in the eyes of all that knew and obſerved their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:171593:44"/> in both, while they were in this Kingdom) it was obſerved that <hi>their Custom</hi> was, and <hi>their Intentions</hi> from thence gathered to be ſuch, That they never would ingage their Army ſingly alone, with any conſiderable Forces of the Enemies, much leſs with his whole Army; except they might have ſuch a conjunction of our Forces with theirs, as were ſufficient to do the work without them; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would be a want of draughts, or ſome other impediment lie in the way, that they could not advance; neither did they ever ingage with the Enemy in a ſet Battle without this, as I have touched before; for that of my Lord <hi>New-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> Forces at their firſt coming in, I have ſhewed, that he had his Army broken before, his Horſe by my Lord <hi>Mancheſters</hi> near <hi>Horn-Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> and his Foot worn out in beſieging <hi>Hull;</hi> ſo that with what he had left, and gathered together out of thoſe Countreys afterwards, he could onely ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh with them, and take the advantages to oppoſe their advance forward into the Kingdom; which, had not our Forces come upon his back, and put him in fear of being incloſed between both, and loſing <hi>York</hi> alſo, he had been likely enough to effect. <hi>Their intentions</hi> were obſerved to be, The keeping of their Army intire and unfoiled, and therefore they never did, nor would adventure the breaking of it, by ingaging without our Forces joyned with them, eſpecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after they had run that hazard in the Battle of <hi>Marſton-moor,</hi> and ſaw by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience what had become of their whole Army, if our Forces had not there been conjoyned with them: This was made apparent at the Committies of both Kingdoms ſitting at <hi>Darby</hi> houſe, upon this very occaſion I now ſpeak to; for when the ſpeedy advancing of the <hi>Scots</hi> Army Southward was much preſſed at the Committee, conſidering the advantages we had then, if they accordingly would march up with ſpeed; the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners alleadge againſt it, <hi>the want and weakneſs of their Army in reſpect</hi> of Horſe <hi>in compariſon of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horſe;</hi> thereupon the Committee, to take away this Objection, ordered 2500 Horſe and Dragooners, under the Command of <hi>Vermuden,</hi> to march to meet them, and come along with them, deſiring the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners to write to them, to haſten their advance according to order, which they did; but when theſe 2500 Horſe had marched as far as <hi>Nottingham,</hi> to joyn with their Army, they were gone, none knew whether, nor upon what errant: the ſame fear alſo, of being put to ingage with the Enemy alone, without the conjunction of our whole Army, made <hi>the</hi> Scotch <hi>Commiſſioners diſlike, and,</hi> as he ſaith, (whence he hath it I know not) <hi>proteſt againſt our Armies beſieging,</hi> or rather as the truth was, lying before <hi>Oxford,</hi> to which I ſhall ſpeak afterwards, but their own Army had freed them from this fear, for they were gone far enough out of danger: the true cauſe therefore that took off their wheels, when they ſhould come Southward, and made them turn about ſo nimbly when they went Northward, was obſerved to be this, They underſtood, that <hi>our Army at that time was to be caſt into a new model, which the Parliament,</hi> as this man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>had juſt reaſon to do, though he like not the manner of doing it:</hi> they conceived that this was likely to cauſe ſo much diſtraction, and ſuch diviſions, that if they ſhould march according to the orders they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the agreement, that thereupon they had made with our Committees in thoſe parts; the King, who had drawn his Forces out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> would have ingaged their Army to fight a Battle with him alone with their own
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:171593:44"/> Forces, before our Armie could be in readineſs to take the Field, and march up to their aſſiſtance; now this they reſolved to prevent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuddenly and unexpectedly take this courſe of running 200 miles back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, whereby they were ſure to be out of Gun-ſhot, and have the buſineſs (as indeed it was) determined before their return. <hi>Another</hi> thing which might be uſed as an Argument to ſatisfie their partie, eſpecially thoſe of their own Countrey the better, in this unlooked for turn-about of theirs, was, That the Town of <hi>Carlile</hi> was then upon Treatie of Surrender to our Committees in thoſe parts; this being a ſtrong Town upon the borders of their Kingdom, on the one ſide, as <hi>Barwick</hi> was on the other, they intend to get it into their own hands, and keep it when they had ſo done, and therefore make haſte thither where our Committees being in Treatie with the Governor about the Surrender of the Town, they fall to Treat with him, and notwithſtanding the proteſtations of our Committees againſt the ſame, yet they grant them in the Town any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they will demand, ſo that the Town may be delivered unto them, which being done, they put a Garriſon of their own into it, and kept it, contrarie to the expreſs Articles of Agreement between the two Kingdoms, in the ſolemn League, which this Diſcourſer ſo often prattles of, &amp; brags the <hi>Scots</hi> always kept themſelves conſtant unto? but what is become, I pray, of your <hi>ſolemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> now? was this the <hi>point</hi> your <hi>Scots</hi> keep themſelves ſo conſtant unto, to keep our Towns out of our hands for their own advantages, falſifying therein their faith given in the Articles of Agreement between the Kingdoms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they were to come in to our aſſiſtance? This buſineſs of <hi>Carlile,</hi> the man afterwards makes a great deal of work to daub over, if it were poſſible, wherein, when we come to it, I ſhall ſhew his untempered morter, wherewith he would make up this breach of Faith, and heal the broken credit of his Countrey-men: In the mean time, theſe were conceived to be the true reaſons of this whirligig-buſineſs, ſo extreamly prejudicial to the preſent affairs of this Kingdom, as that it endangered all, but that the Lord in mercie ſtood by us, and ſaved us at <hi>Naſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie Fight,</hi> when <hi>theſe our Deliverers</hi> (as this moſt fooliſh fellow will ſtill hold them forth to the world to be, in this Lying Pamphlet made purpoſely for them) delivered us up to ſhift for our ſelves, and into the Enemies hands, if we had not been able, without them, to defend our ſelves, and maintain our cauſe againſt them: His Countrey-men took care to deliver themſelves, and therefore would be ſure to be far enough off, and near their own kingdom, into which they might quickly have ſtepped, if the Lord ſhould in this Battle, which was likely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide and determin all, have caſt the Dye of War on the other ſide againſt us; but bleſſed be his name for ever, though man left us in greateſt danger, he forſook us not. The 2500 Horſe and Dragoons, which were ſent to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Armie, to encourage them to advance Southward and to aſſiſt them, when the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was not to be heard of, after they had marched as far as <hi>Nottingham</hi> to ſeek them, came back very ſeaſonably a day or two before the Battle, where they did good ſervice; by which it appears clearly to all men, that the <hi>Scots,</hi> had they marched according to Orders given, and their own promiſes thereupon, might have been advanced further, and incloſed the Enemies either in <hi>Oxford,</hi> or out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> between the two Armies: here we have him at his uſual trade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, painting and colouring over theſe buſineſſes, which had ſo ſullied and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:171593:45"/> caſt durt upon his Countrey-men and blaſted their reputations, that he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, <hi>great murmurings did ariſe againſt them; and thus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the</hi> Scots <hi>were innocently traduced by Malignants;</hi> they that ſpake truth of them and of their carriages in theſe buſineſſes, were indeed innocent, here by a mistake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is aware, he ſpake truth; he will have them <hi>Malignants,</hi> though they be <hi>innocent,</hi> if they ſpeak againſt the <hi>Scots;</hi> but it was indeed an innocent traducing, to ſlander them with a matter of truth: Now he brings forth his common ſalve, to which he flieth when he hath nothing elſe to ſay, that will ſerve the turn to cure the ſore, that is, they are <hi>all Malignants &amp; traducers that ſpeak any thing againſt the honeſt</hi> Scots; before I anſwer in particular to what he alleadgeth in their defence, let it be obſerved, that <hi>this is a threed which runs through the whole work,</hi> hardly a piece without it, the diſcourſe for the moſt part conſiſting all along of complaints made againſt his Countrey-men, and his purgations of them, which what are they, but railings and deviſed tales, to ſlander thoſe men whom he conceives to have reported, or do believe the things complained of, though never ſo true and apparent; this you find almoſt in every leaf; we uſe to ſay, So much ſmoak is not without ſome fire, and certainly, they are reputed to be of no great innocencie, whoſe fame is ſo bad, that they ſtand in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual need of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>purgators. Let us now ſee what the faults are, which they are charged with in theſe particulars, and how he clears them; <hi>the Houſe of Parliament,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>preſs to know, what was become of the</hi> Scots, <hi>and why they had gone this unexpected way, why after ſo many earneſt calls and Orders for it, they would not march Southward,</hi> the good of the publick ſervice ſo much requiring it? He will not here hold up his common buckler in defence, and ſay they are all Malignants, Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, and ſuch as love not the common cauſe of Religion; but when for the ſame things objected againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> he will ſay this of other men, that in ſo uſing the <hi>Scots,</hi> they are to be rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the number of Malignants, and that they are neither honeſt nor faithfull to the cauſe; through their ſides, that complained but of the very ſame things the two Houſes did, he ſtrikes the two Houſes of Parliament as much, for their being unſatisfied with the carriage of the <hi>Scots</hi> herein: he had ſaid a little before, <hi>they were Malignants and traducers who found fault with the</hi> Scots, <hi>for running back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and leaving the whole burthen of the War upon the Forces of the Parliament in the South;</hi> is not this the very ſame complaint, which he here ſaith the two Houſes make againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> for not coming Southward? therefore we ſee what, in his judgement, they are to be accounted; indeed hereby it may appear what account is to be made of thoſe baſe ſlanders, and falſe imputations, he every where caſts upon men of more integritie and ſinceritie a great deal, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Religion, and the common cauſe of juſt Libertie, than thoſe he thereby labors to excuſe: yet the two Houſes of Parliament ſhall have another way found out to give them ſatisfaction, and to that end our comes his <hi>Scotch Manifeſt</hi> again, which, he ſaith, he had touched before; he had ſo, but this ſore muſt have the ſalve often applyed, and all too little to cure it, except in the minds of thoſe men who are of <hi>his ſimpler ſort,</hi> who underſtood nothing of the truth of their carriage in this buſineſs; for whatſoever he boaſts of <hi>the ſatisfaction theſe Papers gave to the Members of the Houſe, who would hearken unto them,</hi> (it may well be many knew them not worth hearkening unto) it ſatisfied no man of underſtanding, that knew, or had a true Relation made unto him of this unexpected and ſtrange
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:171593:45"/> countercourſe of theirs, ſtrange to the Houſes, to the Committees, yea to their own Commiſſioners, as they themſelves profeſſed. But I have anſwered it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, where he before touched it, and whipped <hi>the</hi> Scotch <hi>Commiſsioners</hi> moſt Magiſterially, as there you may read, for <hi>not uſing this practiſe</hi> of his, <hi>out of he knows not what prudential ſcrupuloſitie,</hi> as here he ſaith, which this pedantical Stateſman accounts <hi>their ſimplicite and foolerie;</hi> reproving them again for <hi>their fear to offend in Printing, and ſpreading abroad amongſt the multitude, thoſe things they had by Papers acquainted the Houſes withall, whereas if any thing were to be ſaid of them, although without ground, they muſt hear of it on the deaf ſide of the ear, &amp; it muſt be in every bodies mouth:</hi> what doth he mean? belike he would have them have a deaf ſide, and a deaf ear, when any thing ſhall be ſpoken of them, though never ſo true; but how falſe this is which he ſaith, may appear to all men in the dealing of the Houſes of Parliament with them, when the Letters taken in <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> cabinet were to be Printed and divulged, for there being in ſome of thoſe Letters a relation (as I have ſaid before) of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Comm ſſioners trinckling with <hi>Digbie,</hi> the Kings Secretarie; The Houſes ordered, that Mr. <hi>John Cheeſley,</hi> their Secretarie, ſhould have the peruſal of all the Letters, and put out ſuch things, as any way might reflect upon the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, as that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and many other things, it may be, touched them to the quick, as we uſe to ſay: This was the carriage of the two Houſes towards them; on the other ſide, for <hi>their modeſtie and fear to offend in Printing and publiſhing to the people what they had delivered into the Houſes of Parliament,</hi> though never ſo bitter, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſcandalous complaints and invectives againſt their proceedings, which this man would make the world believe they were too backward in doing, out of that ſcrupuloſitie; the many Papers printed and publiſhed by them, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>John Cheeſley's</hi> name ſubſcribed to them, to avow the act to be theirs, will teſtifie againſt them, to all that ſhall read thoſe printed Papers which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had delivered into the Parliament, that there was little modeſtie, fear or ſcrupuloſitie in them, in this particular: for <hi>the Malignants</hi> he talks of, who ſought to hinder the printing of theſe Papers, and queſtioned the publiſhing of them, under the name of the <hi>Scotch manifeſt,</hi> or rather that Libel (for ſo I may cal a nameleſs Paper disowned, as he ſaith himſelf, by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners, which, he ſaith, was a Copie of their Papers given into the Houſes of Parliament, (whether it was ſo or not, or with what additions, made thereunto by <hi>him into whoſe hands it fell,</hi> which no doubt was himſelf, he beſt knows) but the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants he ſpeaks of, were the Houſe of Commons, who queſtioned the Printer, and the publiſhing of thoſe Papers, and afterwards for this, and ſuch otherlike Paper practiſes of his, printing and ſpreading about Papers in the Citie, to abuſe the people, and ſcandalize the Parliament in a ſeditious way and manner, at laſt ſought after him and made him betake himſelf to his heels and run away: theſe alſo are thoſe he tetms <hi>lye-inventers,</hi> though he would have his <hi>ſimpler ſort</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he means not them, but ſome other malignants? but the Houſe it was, as I ſaid, that queſtioned the Printer, and this practiſe of his. Mr. School-maſter take the title of <hi>Lye-inventer</hi> to your ſelf, it ſures you beſt, and that out of an Author your boys are much verſed in, <hi>tute Lepus es, &amp; pulpamentum quaeris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next he tels us, that <hi>the Houſe of Commons think fit to ſend ſome of their number, to the</hi> Scotch <hi>Armie, to ſee how things went, and to haſten them Southward, who met

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:171593:46"/> them in ſuch relations as he frames for that purpoſe; <hi>that honeſt men were much contented and pleaſed with it, but that it did gaul and vex malignants of all ſorts;</hi> here you have the burthen of the ſong. After this, up ſtarts again <hi>the unexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difficulties this gallant Army ſtruggles with, for want of proviſions and carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> (the want of draughts, we know indeed, very good uſe hath been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made of) <hi>and this,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>through the neglect of ſome, and malice of others, not of the meaneſt ſort,</hi> and ſo hereby he makes himſelf a way for his uſual ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, invectives, and lies againſt honeſt men, indeavouring to make the world believe, that <hi>all the ſervice they have done, is nothing but a cloak to their ambition and covetouſneſs:</hi> here you have his charity, which this fardle of lies that he hath printed, is ſtuffed withall, and ſpecially then brought forth, when his Country-men are to be excuſed: is it not fit that ſuch a fardle be ripped up, and the deceitfull wares therein diſcovered? but <hi>he will leave off complaining of thoſe, who,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>are neither faithfull to the cauſe nor honeſt;</hi> why what is the reaſon? He preſently tells you his reaſon, <hi>becauſe they thus uſe the Scots:</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> muſt leave off to do that which needs your excuſes, before you will leave off your ſlanderous falſe ſurmiſes and invectives. Going on in his diſcourſe, and leaving his complaints (a very little while, as you will ſee) <hi>he will clear,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>three things, first, about the monies, the</hi> Scots <hi>have received; ſecondly, proviſions; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the diſorders committed by them: for the firſt, he begins with giving an aſſurance, in the name of the</hi> Scots, which boldneſs in undertaking for the <hi>Scots,</hi> and in their name, and for the whole eſtate of <hi>Scotland,</hi> what they will do, you may ſee in the 60 page, he ſaith there <hi>to all this the</hi> Scots <hi>do declare truly,</hi> &amp;c. and likewiſe in that foul buſineſs of <hi>Carlile,</hi> while he is daubing it over, he undertakes what the whole State of <hi>Scotland</hi> will oblige themſelves unto: where is this mans Commiſſion, is he one of the Commiſſioners for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland?</hi> or rather a Commiſſioner parramount over them all, he doth ſo often ſchool them, teach them their leſſons, for the better carring on the good cauſe in hand, and reprove them for their indiſcreet miſtakes, and ſcrupuloſities, and want of vigorous proceedings: Let him ſhew his Commiſſion, and his undertakings may be conſiderd; otherways they are to be looked upon, as coming from a Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, who always is, as I have ſaid, the moſt forward, putting man in the whole Pariſh: in this very buſineſs, wherein he doth ſo confidently undertake in the name of <hi>the Scots,</hi> afterwards, he ſaith, <hi>they are (or at leaſt ſhould be) willing unto it;</hi> here is a fine undertaker, and hereby ſhews, what Commiſſion he hath for his bold undertakings: for the things themſelves, every wiſe man knoweth, ſuch a kinde of man as this knew no more of them, nor could ſpeak no more certainly concerning them, than he doth of the things he ſo boldly preſumes to undertake for; that is, either they were ſo, or at leaſt they ſhould be ſo, as he would have them to be; and therefore <hi>he will tell you,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>in general;</hi> with his undertakings, and his generals I will trouble my ſelf no farther, they are of equal credit: onely in this laſt particular, concerning <hi>their diſorders,</hi> he ſpeaks that which all the places where they came will give him credit in, <hi>that they were no Angels of light.</hi> The letter he ſets down from the General, and two others to the Committee, I have already ſhewed, how it is probable it was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, and drawn up, upon the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners ſending down ſome of their company to the Army, to ſee what anſwer might be found out and given to the complaints of the Parliament, for their irregular Northern voyage,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:171593:47"/> wherein they ran counter ſo faſt, and this being then conſulted upon between them, was afterwards ſent up in this letter: After this letter of the Generals and two others, ſent to the Committee, which he ſets down and makes theirs, but may make it what he will himſelf, for where he ſhould have it, or the Copy of it, who knoweth, the reaſon in it, for their marching contrary to order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being no other, then his flying Army which they had intelligence of, a tale I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſpoken to; he now comes to a recapitulation, of what we have heard, &amp; jumps from the midſt of the buſineſs back again to the beginning, and ſo muſt he that will follow him; that which he hath, in this part of his diſcourſe, which is worth taking notice of, I have before anſwered fully, as his invectives againſt <hi>thoſe men, who,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>oppoſed the</hi> Scots, <hi>to whom they had formerly pretended friendſhip, for their own ends,</hi> and <hi>the cauſe of it,</hi> which he will have to be, <hi>they liked not his Kirk-Government, which falſly he ſtill aſsumeth,</hi> and would have the world believe, <hi>the covenant binds us unto, and</hi> as falſly, <hi>that theſe men had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thereunto and promiſed to promote the ſame:</hi> Enough hath been ſaid, to ſhew the falſhood of his continued ſlanders &amp; lies caſt upon theſe men: he hath a touch of <hi>ſome others,</hi> who he ſaith, <hi>were averſe to the incoming of the</hi> Scots <hi>at first into the Kingdom, leſt they ſhould Eclipſe their luſtre</hi> (indeed there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fear of that, as appeared by what was done by them, after their coming in) <hi>but</hi> for <hi>theſe adverſaries,</hi> you ſhall have him and <hi>the Scots,</hi> ſo ſoon as it ſerves their turn, very readily <hi>take them by the hand, and grow intimate friends with them,</hi> as he himſelf will ſhew you afterwards, that which concerns the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of both Kingdoms, as the ſetting of it up, the oppoſing of it by theſe men, and ſuch other ſtories as he hath been told about the managing of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes therein, he is willing to believe himſelf, and make the world believe ſo much of it, as may give him opportunity to ſay ſomething which he thinks may advantage the <hi>Scots,</hi> though for that he caſt falſe ſurmiſes, ſuſpitions, and lies upon other men; all which, in the iſſue will prove little to his own credit, or the <hi>Scots,</hi> when by this means he provokes and gives occaſion to thoſe who know the truth of things, to make them manifeſt to the world, whom he endeavours to abuſe: he inſtanceth in ſome particulars, one, <hi>that the ſecond men</hi> (he hath his firſt and ſecond, you may imagine them whom you pleaſe) <hi>begin to grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the</hi> Scots <hi>ſhould be adjoyned to the Committee, and that there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to do buſineſſes without the</hi> Scots <hi>by naming a Sub-Committee without their knowledge, which made the</hi> Scots <hi>complain to the Houſes:</hi> there needed not much matter, to make them put in papers of complaint to the Houſes, which after wards they might Print and ſpread about to diſaffect the City to the Parliament, this was a uſual courſe with them; but what cauſe was there of complaint, if this had been ſo? If the <hi>Scots</hi> not being there at the preſent, the reſt of the Committee had appointed a Sub-Committee to examine a buſineſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to be reported to the Committee, conſiſting of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> who then are acquainted with it before any thing be acted in it (for Sub-Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees acted nothing, but made report of what they found upon examination, to the Committee for their determination therein) how could this be a deſign to do buſineſs without the <hi>Scots,</hi> or any cauſe of complaint to be made by them in that reſpect? and beſides, what need had <hi>theſe ſecond men</hi> (as he calls them) or any other of the Committee, to finde out and proſecute any ſuch deſign? For if the <hi>Scots,</hi> in any thing that the reſt of the Committee thought fit to be
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:171593:47"/> done, would refuſe to conſent and gave their Negative, there was no more to be done by the reſt, but to acquaint the Houſes with it, and leave it to their determination, which being done, they had diſcharged their duty: but this man writes, as he is informed, and as he and they that gave him his informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, think to make advantage of it, to carry on their own <hi>good cauſe</hi> they have in hand, and who they were that in probability gave him his informations and inſtructions, and ſet him on this good work, may appear by theſe and other particular intelligences, which he relates done at the Committee of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes which muſt be made known by ſome there preſent. His ſecond inſtance will likewiſe manifeſt whence he hath ſuch particular intelligences, and that is of <hi>a ſecret intelligence</hi> given <hi>for the ſurpriſing of</hi> Oxford <hi>at a weak place, and proviſions being then ſcant, and the Town unfurniſhed of them,</hi> this was <hi>given by one</hi> Patrick Napier, <hi>to a Sub-Committee of three, whereof there was one a</hi> Scot, <hi>and this is neglected, notwithſtanding the</hi> Scots <hi>did preſs it much that it might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted:</hi> You will make all men think your <hi>Scots</hi> to be ſome of your ſimpler ſort, and not fit to ſit in ſuch a Committee, when they ſhall truly underſtand what this buſineſs was, if it had been true that they had preſſed the trial of it, for they muſt have been either fools, or falſe, and ſuch as were willing to ruine the new modeled Army unto which indeed they had no great affection. The truth of the buſineſs was this; the L. <hi>Lotherdale,</hi> who was the <hi>Scot</hi> he ſpeaks of in the Sub-Committee of three, and the cauſe of that Sub-Committee, informed the Committee of both Kingdoms, <hi>that there was a man come from</hi> Oxford, <hi>a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of a friend or Kinſman of his there, who had ſomethings to inform the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of, which were worthie of their knowledge, and becauſe the man was not willing to come before the whole Committee publickly, he deſired that a ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee might be appointed to receive his intelligence &amp; report it to the Committee; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon</hi> he himſelf was appointed for one, and there was joyned with him the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Pierepoint;</hi> who withdrawing into another Room, the man was brought by the Lord <hi>Lotherdale</hi> before them, and being asked, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence he could give concerning <hi>Oxford;</hi> he began to tell of many ordinary things of no uſe, nor worth regarding, amongſt which he ſaid <hi>they had no great ſtore of proviſions laid in,</hi> and he ſpake of <hi>one place which was not ſtrongly fortified, but he thought it might be there ſtormed,</hi> or ſomewhat to this effect: the other two who were joyned with the Lord <hi>Lotherdale</hi> in that Sub-Committee, asking him other queſtions, of things more material, and of ſome conſequence for their ſatisfaction herein, that the intelligence m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ght be more certain and worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; the man ſeeing theſe generals and ordinary things he had ſpoken of gave no great ſatisfaction, anſwered, <hi>he could ſay no more for the preſent to what they demanded, but if they would give him a little time, he would come to them again and bring them a more certain and particular information of thoſe things he had ſpoken of, and they deſired to be ſatisfied in:</hi> upon this he was diſmiſſed for that time, and the Sub-Committee went preſently into the Chamber where the Committee ſat, and made report of what they had heard of this fellow, whom he calls <hi>Patrick Napier,</hi> which was indeed of little conſideration as he then left it; ordinary things and generals, as <hi>no great ſtore of proviſions,</hi> a thing fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ground a ſiege upon, which afterwards his <hi>Scots</hi> complain ſo much of, than a ſurpriſe, but it was known the Countries round about them lay open to them, being the beſt Corn-Countries in <hi>England,</hi> and Corn was brought into
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:171593:48"/> the Market twice a week, and when they pleaſed they might command out of the Countreys what they wanted; that there was <hi>a weak part in the Town, where he thought it might be ſurprized,</hi> whereof, when he was demanded particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, he deſired ſome more time to give ſatisfaction in them, this being preſently reported to the Committee, they ſaw little in it conſiderable, but expected what his next coming would produce, and ſo the Sub Committee was continued: the Lord <hi>Lotherdale</hi> after this was divers times aſked, when the man would come to the Sub-Committee again? he anſwered, from one week to another, that <hi>be was not yet readie, but would come as ſoon as he was readie to give them a fuller ſatisfaction in his intelligence;</hi> ſo it was put off from time to time, till at laſt it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared there was no ſuch man to be found or heard of. Neither did the Sub-Committee, or the Committee of both Kingdoms after that time hear of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more: this was an excellent foundation to have laid a deſign upon, of ſuch conſequence as the ſending of a great part of the Armie to attempt the ſurpriſal of <hi>Oxford,</hi> upon an intelligence ſo uncertain, coming from a man that came from <hi>Oxford</hi> (it might be ſent on purpoſe to draw the Forces, which ſhould make the attempt, into a trap) one that the Committee never ſaw before, and when he had promiſed them to come again, to make out his intelligence more full and ſatisfactorie, never appeared afterwards, neither did the Committee know what became of him. This being the truth of this buſineſs, which I believe none of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners will denie, I am ſure they cannot with truth; will any wiſe man think, that they would upon ſuch a ground as this, adviſe, much leſs preſs the Committee to make a trial to ſurpriſe <hi>Oxford?</hi> for my part I believe no ſuch thing, but rather that this man thinking to aſperſe the whole Committee, for ſo he doth, <hi>the neglect</hi> which afterwards <hi>he interprets to proceed out of treacherie &amp; falſhood,</hi> muſt be theirs if any were, for the whole matter was reported to them and to be ordered by them; in ſeeking, I ſay, to disgrace the whole Committee, that he might thereby grace the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners in the opinion of men, as having more fidelitie and ſinceritie, than the reſt (a practice uſual with him) he puts that disgrace upon their Commiſſioners in this, for folly and indiſcretion, if not falſhood, ſhould they, as he ſaith, have <hi>preſſed the Committee to do</hi> ſo ridiculous and unreaſonable a thing, as I think they themſelves, as they were not guiltie of it, ſo they will, as well as the reſt of the Committee, give him the lye in it, which he too often deſerveth: this contents him not, but he adds further, that <hi>the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie is made acquainted with the ſecret advice, and that particularly, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on takes notice of the weakneſs of the place ſpoken of, which before he had not done, &amp; ſtrengthens &amp; fortifies it: and this is discovered by intercepted Letters, which had not been communicated to the</hi> Scotch <hi>Commiſſioners, notwithſtanding the common Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt:</hi> How come you then Sr. <hi>Scot,</hi> to know that there were any ſuch Letters, or any ſuch discoverie made by them, if ſuch letters being intercepted were not communicated to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners? from whom is it that you uſually have your intelligence I pray? they that know no ſuch things themſelves, how can they communicate it to you, whoſe intereſt it ſeems is very common with them? But for the Letters and the things discovered in them, they may both, for ought I know, be the fictions of your fertile brain that way, to caſt durt upon the Committee; let any ſuch Letters appear, or if there were any ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, that ſhewed a discoverie was made to the Enemie of this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence given, why good Sir, may you not <hi>be miſtaken and it be the</hi> Scot

               <hi>that did give the Enemie notice of it,</hi> rather than any of the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> who was it that brought the man to the Committee that made this tale, or gave this ſecret intelligence you ſpeak of, was it not the <hi>Scot?</hi> who afterwards, being often ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto to that end, would yet never bring him to light again, but away he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Committee can ſee him no more: if therefore the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie had any ſuch information given him, of a ſecret intelligence given to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage an enterpriſe upon a place that was weak, which thereupon he better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and that it be not one of your inventions, or your Countrey-mens, I pray why may it not be your Countrey-mans action rather in all probabilitie, than any other mans? Let any indifferent man judge by all the circumſtances; we uſe to ſay, <hi>the Hound that firſt found:</hi> this man who, as I have ſaid, it may be, might be ſent of purpoſe to give this intelligence to catch our Forces, if we had been ſo ſimple as to ſend any upon ſuch a tale, when he had done his errant, might make haſte back again, or be ſent by thoſe to whom he came, to give notice, or carrie intelligence about him what ſervice he had done here, that the Enemie might be prepared to make his advantage of it. For the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, I aſſure my ſelf they ſo little regarded what this fellow ſaid, and ſo much neglected his Intelligence, eſpecially when they ſaw he would not appear again according to his promiſe made to the Sub-Committee, that had any of them had any trinckling with the Enemie (which it had been well if others had been as free from) yet they would have found out things of more moment to acquaint the Enemie withall, than ſuch a ridiculous paſſage, &amp; ſo carried as this was: but they are beſt acquainted how it was discovered to the Enemie (if any ſuch thing were) that can firſt acquaint us there was ſuch a Discoverie made, which is this <hi>lye-inventer</hi> (to return his own phraſe to himſelf who beſt deſerves it) or the men from whom he receives his intelligences. If men would uſe that libertie of judging, which he uſually takes to himſelf upon the like or far leſs occaſions, they would judge, that all this was but an invention from the beginning, to take off the ſuſpition that might be raiſed by this fellows coming from <hi>Oxford,</hi> and applying himſelf to one of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners; and therefore the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner, that he might be with him with the more freedom, till the errant he came about was diſpatched here in Town, covers him with this cloak, <hi>of bringing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence to the Committee,</hi> and makes him tell at firſt a flimflam tale, and then promiſe more particulars in a ſhort time, that thereby more time might be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him to ſtay in Town without ſuſpition, until the buſineſs he came about were ended, and then be ſent back to <hi>Oxford,</hi> as he was when the <hi>Scotch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner and he had thus befooled the Committee: this were a much more likely conjecture, conſidering <hi>Digbies</hi> Letter, and a finer ſtorie, nearer the truth a great deal, than many of thoſe which this mans ſpleen, envie, &amp; malice againſt thoſe <hi>ſome,</hi> and <hi>that partie</hi> (as he terms them) his ſtomach ſtill riſeth at, makes him invent and caſt up, when he can find any occaſion ſo to do, though drawn in by head and ſhoulders, as we uſe to ſay. In the next place he falls upon the Parliament, in ſaying, <hi>the Armie was moulded according to the mind of ſome few men, and that being done, they muſt be appointed to beſiege</hi> Oxford: by whom could either of theſe be done, but by the Parliament, and their Order? for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, in matters of ſuch concernment uſually acquainted the Houſes, and had their direction or approbation. But in the mean time he ſaith, <hi>the Enemie was ſuffered to run up and down, increaſe his Forces, ſpoil the Countreys, and hazard all:</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:171593:49"/> then he brings in his proverbial ſpeech, which he will needs faſten upon <hi>forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> that <hi>the Parliaments Forces were gnawing the bones, while they ſuffer the Enemie to feed upon the fleſh,</hi> and that <hi>there was not, they ſaid, fair dealing every where;</hi> they ſaid in that very true, there was not, but very foul dealing; for who was the cauſe of all this miſchief done by the Enemie? and of his running up and down to do it, but that Armie, who being ordered to advance up Southward to prevent it, and had promiſed ſo to do, and thereupon was expected when this deſign was laid, inſtead thereof, runs 200 miles Northward, and that they might be ſure to keep themſelves far enough out of the Enemies teeth, that their fleſh might not be fed upon by him, they leave him at libertie, unexpectedly to all men, to run up and down and devour the fleſh of the Countreys, and the Town of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> which all men knew, by their coming up South-ward as was ordered and expected, 2500 Horſe and Dragoons being to that end ſent to joyn with them, would have been prevented; either they would have given him Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with a number far exceeding his at his firſt going out of <hi>Oxford,</hi> before he was thus ſuffered to increaſe his Forces (at leaſt if they dealt not falſely with us, but were 21000 according to Articles, and as they required pay for ſo many) or elſe in ſtead of plundering up and down the Countreys (which they gave him fair way to do) he muſt have endeavoured to return again to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to avoid fighting with Forces ſo far ſuperior, by the conjunction of the 2500 Horſe, to thoſe which he had with him, and <hi>Oxford</hi> he would have found blocked up, where the reſt of his Forces were, and all his Ammunition, and himſelf, by his return thither incloſed between the two Armies; a deſign ſo well laid, that if the King finding himſelf thus ſtraitened on all ſides, ſhould have been forced to go Weſtward to his Forces there, under <hi>Hopton</hi> and <hi>Goring, Oxford,</hi> as I have heard themſelves did report, had been taken within three weeks, not expecting a Siege at that time, and therefore no way provided with victuals for it; an Intelligence (had the man ſo much underſtanding in theſe things as to know it) to be made uſe of onely for a Siege, not for a ſurprize; but I ground it not at all upon <hi>Napiers</hi> intelligence given to the Committee, nor did any wiſe man regard that, onely it ſheweth this mans folly; and beſides this, the King had been followed into the Weſt, by a conjunction of both Armies aſſiſting each other, a thing ſo much preſſed by General <hi>Leven</hi> in his Letter before mentioned.

Let any man of judgement and indifferency judge of it, the truth being thus laid open.

He concludes this piece of his ſtory very confidently; ſaying, <hi>let things be tried, and no longer carried in hugger-mugger to the prejudice of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice:</hi> I promiſe you I will do my beſt ſo to uncaſe you, and pull off all your vizards, that you ſhall carry things no longer in this deceitfull way of yours, to the prejudice of the truth; and when you have done ſo, make a ſhew of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſincerity, and caſt your hugger-mugger upon thoſe men who are ſincere indeed and plain hearted.</p>

But they reſolve to hazard their honour, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any part of their Army: we have his confeſſion, that the Enemy came by them but a great way off for fear of them: they were fearfull bugbears indeed it ſeems unto them; had they by following the Enemie made themſeſves fearfull to him, he had never had the means and opportunity ſo to ſtrengthen himſelf, as to come by their noſes, and afterwards do all the miſchief he did at <hi>Huntington,</hi> and up and down thoſe Countries, and then make them ſo afraid of him as to riſe and be gone: but <hi>David Leſly preſently followed them with moſt of their Horſe, and went before them,</hi> he ſaith, but why did he not rather go up to them, but went ſo, that as he confeſſeth, <hi>it was murmured, he was gone no man knew whither, and the Enemie went whither he would</hi> for any oppoſition that he received from him, to <hi>Newwark,</hi> then to <hi>Huntington</hi> and towards <hi>Bedford,</hi> plundering up and down till he came to <hi>Oxford,</hi> without being followed at all by theſe to whom that care was Committed: nay, he ſo little feared or cared for their following of him, when once he ſaw himſelf ſecure and free from the Parliaments Army, that going to <hi>Newwark</hi> without oppoſition or hinderance, he ſent from thence, as I have ſaid, 1600 of his Horſe under <hi>Digby</hi> and <hi>Langdale</hi> into <hi>York-ſhire</hi> to joyn with <hi>Montroſs,</hi> who in many places, as they went by <hi>Doncaster,</hi> beat up our quarters, and at <hi>Sherborn</hi> tooke 800 priſoners; where was <hi>David Leſly and his Horſe</hi> all this while, which he ſaith <hi>were purſuing the Enemie about Trent?</hi> had he done any thing in the purſuite of them, you ſhould have been ſure to have heard of it, and had it in great Letters: but whereas he ſaith <hi>the Pamphlets at London were ſtuffed with what our forces did or would do therein,</hi> the man (not afraid to uſe the name of God here) ſaith <hi>God knoweth they were far away from the Enemie,</hi> which is ſo falſe (as ſhew me one Pamphlet amongſt them all ſtuffed with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſhoods as this) that it is well known, this party of 1600 Horſe going into

            <p>We have him now again at <hi>the new modelling of the Armie,</hi> which a little before he ſaid was done <hi>according to the mind of ſome few men,</hi> imputing that weakneſs to the Houſes of Parliament, that a few men could impone upon them, and lead them as they pleaſed; this leſſon he was taught by the Court, and learned of the Caveliers, as I have ſhewed, thus would they do when they intended in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, to traduce the proceedings of Parliament, and render them odious to the people: he confeſſeth <hi>the Parliament had juſt reaſon to do it, in reſpect of the many and great miscarriages, which they could not by fair means redreſs, and that this was by the fault of thoſe imployed in the ſervice, whether for want of skill, or care, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie, he will not enquire;</hi> but had it been in this new-modelled Armie, he would certainly have been ſo inquiſitive, as to have found a fault where none was, which will appear afterwards; onely here he will be modeſt, for it concerns thoſe whom his Commiſſioners took ſo kindly by the hand and embraced, when they quite left off and quitted honeſt men, at which he acknowledgeth the people murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

It is not bragging and prating of brave fellows, which makes them ſuch, but acting bravely and wiſely: it is true that there were ſome able and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Commanders of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who did very good ſervice, and if theſe would have ſtayed and kept their Commands, it was that which was deſired; but for the generallitie of them, they were found to be ſuch, as that before the new-modelling of this Armie, they were in great numbers left to <hi>walk</hi> (as in one place he ſaith of ſome of them) <hi>from the Ayle-horſe at</hi> Weſtminſter, from one Tavern and Ale-houſe to another, and then to <hi>Weſtminſter-hall;</hi> and this was their march for a long time; yet for this theſe Reformadoes muſt have ſome pay to ſend them home, and we were glad ſo to be rid of them; at our firſt taking up of Arms in our own defence, there came ſtore of them to <hi>London,</hi> under what Titles they pleaſed to put upon themſelves, in reſpect of the former ſervices they ſaid they had been in; there were not then many experienced Officers and Soldiers of the Parliaments ſide, ſo theſe were taken, and much was expected from them, but when upon ſome trial it was found, a little experience in theſe our unhappy Wars could make much more uſefull Soldiers, for our ſervice, of our own Nation, theſe, as I have ſaid before, were left to walk the ſtreets, except it were <hi>ſome</hi> who

For his long diſcourſe how <hi>they were ſought and Courted by the Enemy,</hi> out of his great opinion of their abilitie, it is his uſual way to find out deviſes to magnifie his Countrey-men, through this whole Pamphlet, as the Reader muſt needs obſerve, I will not trouble my ſelf with it in every place, it is ſo groſs, that it renders it ſelf ſufficiently ridiculous: what <hi>dealing</hi> there was <hi>between the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and them,</hi> I leave to themſelves, they beſt know, but this I will ſay, as I have had cauſe to ſay often, that this vanitie and folly in thus bragging and boaſting of the <hi>Scots</hi> throughout the whole Pamphlet, and inventing long ſtories to that end, as here concerning <hi>the Enemies courting of them,</hi> and <hi>the great exploits they did at</hi> Leiceſter, doth them no right nor advantage: he talks of <hi>the Pamphlets at London,</hi> how they <hi>would have been filled if any ſuch things had been done by others;</hi> but ſhew one Pamphlet amongſt them all ſo farc'd and crambed with ſuch-like ſtuff as this is, and that makes every underſtanding man who reads it, look upon it as a framed thing, ſet forth for that purpoſe, and ſo give little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to it, as indeed it deſerves no other.

Now that he might bring in one of his wiſe diſputes, he tells us <hi>the reaſon why ſome men are backward to take this oath;</hi> and that is <hi>becauſe they are adverſe to the Government of the Church by Presbyterie;</hi> which is a thing that hath no truth in it, but he will feed his fancy with it, becauſe he hath entertained this fancy before, and is very induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to make others believe it, that <hi>by the covenant a man is bound to ſet up Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian government, and ſuch a Preſbyterian government as they have moulded and framed and do exerciſe in Scocland;</hi> whereas in the drawing up of the Covenant by the Aſſemby of Divines, and a Committee of the Houſes joyned with them, that care was taken, that the Word of God ſhould be the Rule in all, and then ſuch Cautions and Limitations were ſet down for every mans proceeding according to that rule, that what he did ſhould not exceed the bounds of his place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; ſo that, as the ſence of the Covenant was then taken to be in the Debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and agreed upon, there was no Independent (as he diſtinguiſheth them) refuſed to take the Covenant, more than a Preſbyterian; even thoſe of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly whom he rails upon, and ſharpeneth his invenomed pen againſt (men for pietie and learning, whoſe books, he and ſuch as he is, are not worthie to carrie after them) took it as readily as any; and ſo did <hi>his prime Independents,</hi> Officers of the Armie, and Members in the Houſes (for ſuch they muſt all be, that his hot <hi>Scotch</hi> Preſbyterian head, to ſerve his ends, will caſt that term upon:) But if any afterwards were backward to take it, the chief reaſon of it was, that the <hi>Scots,</hi> and ſuch as deſired to make uſe of it to ſerve their ends, and carrie on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, would put their ſenſes upon it, and make ſuch interpretations of it as ſerved their turns beſt, and accordingly urge and preſs ſome parts and pieces of it, but for the reſt regard it as little; this made many refuſe the taking of it, or the preſſing of it upon others, when they ſaw ſuch uſes made of an Oath; and good reaſon they had to ſhew and teſtifie their dislike of the abuſes of Oaths and Covenants wherein the name of God is intereſſed, when they ſaw men make that uſe of them, to carrie on their deſigns and compaſs their own ends the better.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſe he firſt falls into, he brings in thus, <hi>a prime man,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who are adverſe to the Government of the Church, ſpake openly,</hi> That though in his judgement, he did not approve of Presbyterial Government in the Church, yet he at all times would ſubmit to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Church-Government the Parliament ſhould ſettle, either by active or paſſive obedience: This the man will needs have to be a great abſurditie, while the abſurd man in the mean time, either cannot for want of wit, or for want of ingenuitie will not diſtinguiſh, between giving obedience to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:171593:58"/> the thing commanded by doing of it, and to the Authoritie that doth command it; for to this, obedience is given by ſubmitting to what puniſhment ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ſhall inflict, in caſe that be not done which is commanded, and that without reſiſtance for conſcience ſake: lawfull Authoritie (which is not to be reſiſted but obeyed for conſcience ſake) may command things unlawfull, which are not to be done; in this caſe, as Dr <hi>Ameſius</hi> in his Theologie ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 391, <hi>Si Praeceptum fit Illegitimum, tum teleratio poenae cum injuriâ inflictae, vim &amp; locum habet obedientiae:</hi> and for proof thereof, he brings that place in the 1 of <hi>Peter</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19, 20. <hi>if any ſuffer for doing well</hi> (which they do who ſuffer becauſe they refuſe to do that which is evil) <hi>this,</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>is an obedience acceptable to God</hi> in ſervants towards their maſters; &amp; ſo is it in all Inferiors to their Superiors: and what doth this man in denying it, but impute diſobedience to authority to all Martyrs of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, and all thoſe who have ſuffered in theſe modern times; for if obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may not be performed to authority, by patient undergoing what ſhall be inflicted by them who are in authority, when men cannot lawfully do what is commanded, then neceſſarily they all, and whoſoever ſhall follow their example are to be accounted diſobedient to <hi>authoritie,</hi> and ſo <hi>reſisters of the ordinance of God, whereby</hi> for their Martyrdom <hi>they ſhall receive damnation.</hi> Here you have his Divinity; his Philoſophy is as good; <hi>all virtue conſiſts in action,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a virtue, cannot therefore be ſaid to be paſſive:</hi> as if there were no action in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereas the higheſt Act of virtue in a Chriſtian is patient &amp; willing ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf to ſuffer perſecution for righteouſneſs ſake; is there no virtuous Act of the will, when it offers the body or ſtate to ſuffer what authority ſhall inflict though unjuſtly, becauſe it will not reſiſt authority, tho it cannot do what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thereby, being unlawfull? but I trouble my ſelf too much in anſwering ſuch a new device, and idle fancy, being contrary to the known received truth by all, both Divines, and others of any underſtanding; and therefore the Pedagogue ſhould not have been ſo bold, magiſterially (as is his guiſe) <hi>to reprove him that firſt invented this expreſſion of paſſive obedience and thoſe alſo that ſince have made uſe of it.</hi> At laſt he remembers himſelf, that <hi>divines ſpeak much of the paſsive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our Saviour,</hi> and there being gravelled and at a non-plus, having before denied any ſuch thing as paſſive obedience, he hath nothing elſe to anſwer, <hi>but that this is of another condition, and belongs to another place:</hi> what place I pray ſhall we finde for that which is nothing? if there be no ſuch thing as paſſive obedience, then there is no obedience in the paſſion of our Saviour offered up to God, which were little ſhort of blaſphemy to affirm: his willing <hi>laying down his life (John</hi> 10.18.) <hi>as he received Commandement from the Father,</hi> and undergoing the wrath of God for our ſins, though a paſſion, was as much an Act of obedience as his doing all that was commanded in the law; and therefore obedience to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority may be performed as truly, and as much, yea more in ſuffering than in doing, but as I ſaid, I have been too long in confuting ſuch an idle new up-ſtart foolery, onely it may be this may ſerve to make a diſcovery of the mans ſpirit, and others like him, ſhewing what they would be at, if they can cloak any thing with the name of <hi>Religion;</hi> the carrying of it on and the compaſſing of their ends in it, muſt be by action, though againſt lawfull authority, not by ſuffering, by which the antient Martyrs ſpread religion through the world, but with theſe men ſuffering is no virtue.</p>

            <p>His ſecond diſcourſe which I now come unto, makes this the more probable compared with that which I have noted before of his magnifying the zeale of their anceſtors in carrying on the work of religion ſo actively in Scotland, which how they carried it on is well known: as he brought in, and had <hi>one</hi> for his firſt diſcourſe, ſo he hath for this ſecond another <hi>one,</hi> who is made to <hi>ſpeake publiquely, that the main quarrell the Parliament ſtood for at firſt, and for which they took up armes, was not religion: this</hi> in the firſt place he ſaith <hi>is a great wrong to the wiſedome of the Parliament, for any to aver, and publiſh, that the Parli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The man enters upon his ſilly Obſervations (for ſuch I may well term them) with this in the firſt place, <hi>That the words are ſet down in ſuch a way, that what they mean, he that reads them can hardly reach unto, and that this ſeems to be done of purpoſe:</hi> The words are ſo plain, and the meaning ſo clear to him that will underſtand, that it may much rather be thought, this man is deſirous to caſt foggs and miſts upon them, that <hi>the ſimpler ſort,</hi> whom he ſpeakes of afterwards, might be the better prepared to entertain his falſe gloſſes upon them to their deluding. That which he deſires in this piece of his Letter is (as I have ſaid) that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of judgement in things outward and of ſmaller conſequence, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing names, caſt upon men to breed and hold up diviſions, might not cauſe difference in affection amongſt brethren: To perſwade to this, he firſt ſhews it feiſeable by their practiſes and example where he is; and then urgeth that ſtrong and undeniable reaſon for it, the real unity that there is between thoſe who are believers and true Chriſtians, being members of one body, united to one head, the Lord Chriſt, and this union being inward and ſpirituall is ſo glorious as not to have breaches made in it: for outward formes, and uniformity in them, for peace ſake Chriſtians will ſtudy to conform unto, ſo far as with a good conſcience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved they may; but untill their judgement and reaſons have light ſufficient to convince them of the lawfulneſſe of things, it is expected (and well may be) from
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:171593:75"/> brethren, though in Authority, not to compel thereunto a doubting unſatisfied conſcience; the commands and lawes of men bind the outward man and reach to his converſation, but the mind and conſcience muſt be left to God to work upon, <hi>Cogi non poteſt fides;</hi> what is not done of faith is ſin, and to compell to ſin is not the Magiſtrates part or duty: If therefore the things be of ſuch a nature, as that they be groſſe ſcandalous ſinnes, and dangerous errors in reſpect of infection of others, and ſeducement; the Magiſtrate may and ought in ſuch caſes to proceed in the Negative, to forbid the outward actings and practiſe of ſuch things, being in their natures deſtructive to the foundations of Chriſtian Religion, and not ſuffer and permit men to hold them forth in their converſations amongſt others, to offend and leaven them to their ruine; no more than he ought to ſuffer a man to run up and down, with a Plague ſore running upon him, to deſtroy others: But in the Affirmative to force men outwardly to act that, and not forbear alone, but practiſe what is contrary to their conſciences, and the light which as yet they have attained to, this is not to be done by a Chriſtian Magiſtrate to any, much leſſe to brethren; herein he, as well as others, if he have faith, muſt have it to himſelf before God, and not compell other men to ſin, by forcing them to act and to doe things contrary unto, or with a doubting conſcience, untill they ſhall be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and if not by example in things of indifferency and inferior conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how much leſſe, in matters meerly of outward form, by compulſion and force is this to be done? and this is that which is meant by theſe words, <hi>things of the mind,</hi> as is cleared by the reference of them to the conviction of enlightned reaſon, and the oppoſition of them to outward and other things: In the laſt place he acknowledgeth the authority of the Magiſtrate, with this brand upon thoſe who would exempt themſelves from it, that they knew not the doctrine of the Goſpel, and this to muzzle the foul mouths of thoſe, who caſt upon them the names of <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> and they that ſhall indeavour, either by <hi>pretences</hi> of Religion, or whatever elſe, <q rend="inline">to ſteal the ſword out of the Parliaments hands, or by force to wreſt it from them <hi>(whom he acknowledgeth hereby to be the lawful Authority over them and others)</hi> he hopes their indeavours ſhall be without effect:</q> Oh well ſpoken, with all my ſoul, I wiſh as well practiſed! Here is the ſum and ſubſtance of all contained in this piece of the Letter, which the man ſnarles ſo much at; and what could be more chriſtianly deſired, or more clearly and plainly delivered? what more conſonant to the doctrine of the Apoſtles, witneſſe <hi>Romans</hi> 13. and many other Scriptures? and who, but he that will muzzle himſelf up ſtill in his own malice, could find any intricacy and perplexity in the expreſſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

This I my ſelf know to be a truth, and can teſtifie the ſame, and could name many of the men, having lived long with them, and ſeen and known their converſations. I have been willing to inſiſt the longer upon this, not onely to ſhew how ridiculous his Obſervation is upon theſe words of unity in the Spirit of Faith and Prayer, and not ſuffering names, and differing in opinion in ſome things to breed difference in affection between thoſe who have the ſame Faith, the ſame Spirit, the ſame Lord and head, and the ſame God, but moſt of all, becauſe as he that writes it, ſo I with my ſoul deſire that this unity of the Spirit in the band of peace and brotherly love might be more obſerved and practiſed in all places, notwithſtanding theſe names, and the things for which they have been caſt upon men: but I ſee now, as I did alſo obſerve in thoſe times, many hot headed men carried on with a fiery zeal, which comes not from the Altar, ſo caught by Satan in this Mouſe-trap of names, which he hath ſet up for that purpoſe, that they cannot indure to hear of a chriſtian exhortation hereunto, or deſire thereof, without putting their own unchriſtian interpretations and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon the ſame, as this man here, and ſo divers others of his Spirit.</p>

               <hi>His</hi> 2d <hi>Obſervation</hi> is no other than a falſe affirmation; let him bring one inſtance to prove it if he can, and he ſhall not be thought altogether ſo falſe in his affirmations as he will needs publiſh himſelf in print to be; let him name the man whom he will have to be an <hi>Independent, that hath with fierceneſſe oppoſed, or

            <p>The 3d is of the ſame nature, as falſe, whether we reſpect the carriage of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independent,</hi> eſpecially thoſe in the Aſſembly, whom he, as before and here, you may ſee principally ſhoots his bolt at (give me leave to ſay it often, ſince he ſo often will deſerve it) what <hi>meekneſſe of mind and patience the</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians <hi>have uſed towards the</hi> Independents in the Aſſembly, I have ſhewed before, and thoſe that know and did obſerve the carriages of both in their debates there, and in their reaſons and anſwers given in in writing one to another, can teſtifie; he doth no more here than often in other places, <hi>fortiter calumniari &amp; impudenter:</hi> for the <hi>extravagarces the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>would bring them from, and the truth of God</hi> (as he will have it) <hi>which they would have them ſubmit unto,</hi> what is this but fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly to beg the queſtion in hand? that he would have them no longer born withall, and indured, but fire come preſently from heaven and deliver him and his from them, that is conſonant to all the reſt which comes from his ſpirit; I would he knew of what ſpirit he is therein, that he might repent for it.</p>
            <p>His 4th <hi>Obſervation</hi> hath ſuch a preheminence in falſhood that all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can manifeſt the ſame to be falſe, whether you look into City, Town, or Country; for thoſe he will call <hi>Independents,</hi> whether at home, or abroad, in old <hi>England</hi> or in New, they are ſo far from <hi>branding a</hi> Presbyterian, <hi>becauſe ſuch, with the name of prophaneneſſe,</hi> or a thought thereof, or <hi>thinking them unworthy of holy ſociety</hi> with them, that they doe not, nor will not, for that difference in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely, knowing them otherwiſe to be truly godly, refuſe to admit them into their neareſt and deareſt Societies, their Church fellowſhips, neither doe they think they ought; and this common experience of their practiſe herein will teſtifie againſt this impudent falſhood of his charged upon them.</p>
            <p>In the 5th <hi>Obſervation</hi> he makes a <hi>riddle, and bids him to ſolve it who will;</hi> it is as eaſily ſolved, as fooliſhly made and called a riddle; his riddle is this, Presbyterians <hi>and</hi> Independents <hi>are ſaid to have an inward unity, whence is it then, that they agree not in things of the mind which are eſteemed inward? the conſcience is a part of the mind, yet it ſuffers not</hi> Independents <hi>to uniform with</hi> Presbyterians: Amongſt all the riddles that in the riddle book are taught children for ſport, I think there is not to be found ſo childiſh a one as this: can there be no inward and reall unity, where, in any thing whatever, there is any difference? for in the diſtinction that he himſelf makes of <hi>things of the mind,</hi> he ſaith, they <hi>are things that remain within the mind and goe no further, or things that proceed and come from the mind and are outward,</hi> and this latter he extends afterward to all things; <hi>for the firſt, thoſe that remain in the mind, and come not out, nor goe further, there can be no compulſion of them</hi> he ſaith; and ſo I ſay, if they never come forth of the mind nor
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:171593:77"/> be diſcovered, in them there can be neither agreement nor diſagreement, for who can know what they are? therefore the agreement that is between men muſt be <hi>in things that come out from the mind,</hi> and ſo are diſcovered, not that abide and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the mind and cannot be known, and theſe, in his acception of theſe words <hi>[things of the mind]</hi> are all things that concern Church or State, all that are proper to men above meerly naturall and ſenſible creatures, as in his eighth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation he hath it: then mark, I will not ſay what a <hi>riddle</hi> he makes of this, but what a fooliſh poſition and falſe he layeth down, which no man of underſtanding would ever have done, if his inconſidering Zeal had not tranſported him to ſay he neither knew, or cared what; that is, if there be a difference between men in any one thing, ſo that they doe not uniform in all things, there can be no inward unity between them, and it is <hi>a riddle to ſay there is:</hi> Will not any, who is acquainted with Scripture, or I may ſay, that is above his <hi>meerly naturall and ſenſible creatures,</hi> and hath underſtanding to obſerve what hath, and doth daily paſſe between men in the world, ſee the falſhood and willful folly herein expreſſed? <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> had an inward unity, the ſame Spirit of faith and prayer, as here is ſaid, and were united inwardly and ſpiritually by the ſame Spirit to one Head, and one to another, as members of the ſame myſticall body, yet they did not agree in all things of the mind, for one was of the mind that <hi>John Mark</hi> ſhould not goe to viſit that work which he had before deſerted, and the other was of opinion that it was fit to take him along with them notwithſtanding, and this difference conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued between them, and was ſufficiently diſcernable, and yet will he ſay it is a riddle to affirm that there was an inward union between them and ſpiritua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l unity at that time? So <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> differed, when <hi>Paul</hi> reproves him in things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion: if he ſhall anſwer, theſe were particular actions and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges falling out in their converſations, not different opinions that they held and profeſſed in matters of Religion, yet they will fall under his acceptation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the words, and extending of them to all things in his eighth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and then they make for him this abſurd concluſion, that between theſe Apoſtles it were a riddle to ſay there was any inward ſpirituall unity. But in thoſe times there were many thouſands of the believing <hi>Jewes,</hi> who were zealous of the Ceremonies of the Law, as the Elders at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> told <hi>Paul,</hi> not having yet light enough to convince them, That the Subſtance being come, theſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were to ceaſe; the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> having more light in that particular, were of another mind and judgement according to the truth; and this difference in matters of Religion, and of far greater conſideration and conſequence than what I have ſhewed to be between <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> was held up and maintained with too much ſtrife and contention between them; conſcience not permitting the <hi>Jewes</hi> to uniform with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as is clear by the directions given therein by the Apoſtles, and by that 14th Chapter to the <hi>Romans;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, ſhall any man be ſaid to ſpeak riddles, that affirmes there was a reall inward ſpirituall union between theſe believing <hi>Jewes</hi> and Chriſtian <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> who had imbraced the Goſpel? And that <hi>holding the head, they were,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2 19. <hi>knit together by joynts and bands</hi> which are inward and ſpirituall, and did increaſe and grow up together according to the meaſure of every part with the increaſes of God: while we live here in this life we are imperfect, and know but in part, and therefore being of different ſtature in knowledge, there
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:171593:77"/> is and will be difference of opinion in ſome things of Religion amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who notwithſtanding by an inward and ſpirituall union, as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13, 15, 16. <hi>Grow up in him who is the head, even Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of every part, as many members, and of ſeverall ſtatures, united in one body, and increaſing, and edifying one another in love.</hi> I wiſh theſe Zealots for tithing of Mint, Aniſe and Cumin were better acquainted with theſe great things of the Goſpel, which they neglect for ſuch things as are not to be regarded ſo much, as this tithing in thoſe times, being a thing commanded; they would not then call what in this Letter is affirmed, and, ſutably to that example, deſired to be practiſed in other places, a riddle, which their fiery fleſhly Zeal and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance makes them doe: And, but that I am willing to inſiſt upon this point, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring it may be better known, and better practiſed amongſt Chriſtians, occaſion being miniſtred unto me by this ignorant or malicious Obſervation, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed troubled my ſelf and the Reader too much in diſcovering the ſillineſſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it.</p>
            <p>His 6th <hi>Obſervation:</hi> I have anſwered in ſhewing what the Wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er meant by <hi>Compulſion in things of the mind,</hi> as may be well enough underſtood by ſuch as have not a will to cavill; for the thing in queſtion is uniformity in formes with <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that which he deſires and expects from brethren, being Magiſtrates, is, that men be not compelled thereunto untill they have light ſufficient to convince their reaſons of the lawfulneſſe thereof; therefore to wreſt this to ſuch a ſence that <hi>men may have liberty to ſay, write, and doe whatſoever is in their mindes,</hi> is either great ignorance, or wilfull out of malice; for by compulſion to keep men from ſaying, writing, and doing whatever comes into their minds, is to put compulſion upon thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> outward actions in reſtraining them, which he grants the Magiſtrate hath power in; but to compell mens minds to think this or that is lawfull, and therefore to force them to act accordingly, and practiſe it for uniformities ſake, before they ſhall have light ſufficient to convince their reaſon of the lawfulneſſe of it, which is not in the power of man to give; this is a metropolitan and prelatical practiſe, as we know in the compelling of Subſcription; and this he expects Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrates will not doe, and well he may expect it, if they will keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the rules of the Apoſtles doctrine: there is great difference between re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining men from venting, publiſhing, and acting their errors when they are groſſe, ſcandalous, and deſtructive to others, and compelling and forcing men for to act and practiſe that, which they in their conſciences judge to be unlawfull, for conformity ſake: the one the Magiſtrate may and ought to doe, but not the other; he may, and ought to reſtrain ſin; but not to force men to ſin againſt conſcience, by practiſing and acting what they think to be unlawfull, untill they have light to convince them of the lawfulneſſe of ſuch things, as they are required to conform unto: therefore this concluſion, of his is a meer cavill ariſing from an ignorant, or wilfull miſtake and wreſting of the words.</p>
            <p>In his 7th <hi>Obſervation</hi> he cavilleth at the words <hi>Light and Reaſon,</hi> and ſaith, that <hi>all the phanaticall phrenſies, that have been broached, doe pretend thereunto, no men pleading ſo much for reaſon as the</hi> Socinians, <hi>and</hi> Arminians, <hi>except our</hi> Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Becauſe all hereſies and phanatical men have made uſe of the Scriptures, and pretended their hereſies and phanſies to be warranted thereby, is this a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:171593:78"/> good reaſon to object againſt the right uſe of the Scriptures, or againſt thoſe who mention the Scriptures? So if ſome falſely pretend to light, and attribute too much to Reaſon, ſhall it be a fault in others to deſire to be guided by Reaſon inlightned out of the Scriptures, and not compelled to act contrary to the ſame? For his preferring his <hi>Independents</hi> (for ſo he calls them, and well may he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch onely of his own making) <hi>before the Socinians and Arminians, in pleading for reaſon,</hi> it is well known, that no men keep themſelves more cloſely and exactly to the Word, without admitting of any humane policies, or humane reaſon, in the very matters of Church government, than theſe men doe whom he would make <hi>Independents,</hi> acknowledging the diſcipline and government of Churches to be inſtituted by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and nothing that is to be done therein, in the leaſt circumſtance, to be left to the reaſon and policy of men, but ordered by the Word, either in the expreſſe precepts thereof, or by the generall rules of order, decency, and edification, ſet down therein; and I am ſure this Zealot for his Kirk government cannot ſay ſo much for That, and prove it, if their practiſe be examined, and proof out of the Scriptures be brought for it; and that in reſpect of divers particulars. <hi>How their Rabbies in the Synod have proved their light to be clear, and their reaſons to be true, it is well known,</hi> he ſaith: I agree with him, it is ſo well known by their reaſons and anſwers given in in writing, that by whom thoſe ſhall be ſeen either now or hereafter, it will appear how falſe that is which he affirmes of <hi>their being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Word of God, or their light proved thereby to be darkneſſe, and their reaſon erroneous;</hi> and therefore untill that could be done, which will be found to be far from being done at that time, they had reaſon to continue in that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they had warrant for out of the Word of God: for <hi>the practiſe of the reformed Churches,</hi> that is no rule, farther than their practiſe is agreeable to the Word of God, which is the onely rule; and as they have reformed many things, ſo there may be the ſame need yet to reform in ſome other things, wherein they may be wanting, or have been miſtaken: for the ſtate of the beſt and moſt reformed here in this life is a ſtate ſhort of perfection.</p>
            <p>In his 8th <hi>Obſervation</hi> he comes in with, <hi>again he ſaith, "We look for no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion;</hi> the Writer ſaith no ſuch thing again, but this man will needs cavill again, and to that end bring it in again; well let us ſee what he will be at now again; though I have anſwered this; and many of the reſt, by ſhewing the true meaning of the Writer in thoſe words <hi>["Compulſion for things of the mind] then I pray thee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is not the common Law of</hi> England <hi>a thing of the mind;</hi> whom ſpeaks he to, is he now turned to ſome Petty-fogger of the Law? well, what then? <hi>why this man denieth the Parliament to have any thing to doe with it, nor with the Church, nor with the State, ſeeing they have nothing to doe with things of the mind:</hi> Well argued and concluded once again Mr. <hi>Rhombus;</hi> or wittingly and wilfully contrary to clear light: for in this ſenſe, wherein the man will take things of the mind, that is, which come forth from the mind, <hi>as all actions proper: o men doe,</hi> as he himſelf concludes in this 8th Obſervation; as he ſaith, the Common Law of <hi>England is</hi> a thing of the mind, ſo he may as well (as himſelf confeſſeth) ſay the ſame of any thing whatſoever done by a man indued with reaſon, and not by a beaſt or unreaſonable creature: How can he then with any conſcience or care of ſpeaking

            <p>That which followeth is nothing elſe but a manifeſtation of the ſame ſpirit of Malice, Falſehood, and Envy; for finding well-deſerving in the men, and not being able to deny the ſervices performed by them, he will invent ſome matter to detract from their merit, as Envy alwaies doth, though never ſo falſe and fooliſh, and that here he doth, beginning with non-ſence: <hi>If it were againſt a Forraign Enemy,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>he would acknowledge the ſervice done by the Independents, to be the part of good Patriots; but the caſe is otherwiſe here, we have a civill Warre for Religion and Liberty, both which, the declared Enemy, though intestine, would ſubvert and spoyle by any meanes, if he could, and ſet up Tyranny;</hi> and what then? there he leaves, leſt he ſhould fall into one of theſe two, either to praiſe the <hi>Independent</hi> as a good <hi>Patriot</hi> for his ſervice herein; or elſe ſay, that to help or aſſiſt againſt thoſe that indeavour to ſubvert Religion and Liberty, though by an inteſtine Warre and Enemy, were not praiſe-worthy: what a fooliſh argumentation have we here? he would make a difference, where, in reſpect of the good ſervice done, there is no difference, but this that is to their advantage, that aſſiſting in the later, <hi>(a Civill Warre against Religion and Liberty to overthrow both)</hi> makes the ſervice, in reſiſting thereof, to be of greater merit, becauſe it manifeſteth greater ſincerity to Religion and Liberty, from the defence whereof no private relations could withdraw them, and ſo makes his Objection moſt idle, therefore in the end he breakes off abruptly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes juſt nothing from the difference he had begun withall: the Man had run himſelf cleane out of breath with railing, and ſo ſits downe as one at a loſſe, who knew not where he was, nor what he had ſaid, and what to ſay next. The reſt is all of the ſame ſtuffe, falſe, fooliſh, ridiculouſly fooliſh, as the Reader may obſerve, and hath been often before ſhewed; therefore I will not take the paines to run after him any farther, in this idle piece of the Diſcourſe, which makes it appeare his malice can hardly end, no not when it grows to be ridiculous in the eyes of any ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious man, if the ſubject of his Diſcourſe be the men that he thinkes will never be brought to worſhip his Idoll, for his ſpleen ſo blindes him, that be ſeeth not, this difference caſts out his Scots with all their great ſervices from being good Patriots, as much as the Independents.</p>
